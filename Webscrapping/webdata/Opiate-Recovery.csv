"You can double up if youre scared of precips. By that I mean the Bernese method. Micro dose induction while still using.  Ie you take .125 mg your first day before you use your doc, then .25 the second day, wait a little bit, use your doc, increasing 1/8th of a mg per day. You can go faster if need be. My Old doc used .5 the first day, .5x2 second day, 1mg third day.  The key is not increasing your use of your doc. Once youre on 1mg per dose of bupe youll start to more or less stabilize & wont need the doc as much. This works even with fentanyl. The thing is, above .5/1mg of bupe, you start to block a lot of the fent, so you gotta power through those awkward days where the bupe isnt fully active yet but is starting to block the fent.

"15-22 10/325 Norco a day. Id get so sick and anxious if I didnt have them and it was fucking hell. Every day Id start off telling myself that I wouldnt take more than 10 a day and always did. The first time I got a text from my plug after taking kratom, I declined and it was the most liberating feeling in the world. It is 100% doable. I personally would pass out after all the norco, so I was basically asleep for a decade. It was a little hard to find ways to fill my time. For reference: I took about 15 capsules of the Red Borneo 3 times a day. ",2022-03-20T19:33:44+00:00,"10/325 Norco, kratom, norco, Red Borneo",anxious
"Yes life sucks still , I havent been in the streets since 2018. Got locked up and when I got out started getting High again but this time while opening a business. As u said by the grace of god I have always done the right thing and been able to grow and flourish. Im honest and have a trustworthy reputation and do great work. For a couple years the succeeding and making money was nice. Feeling like a boss and having people take you seriously again was nice, Felt great to save 30 40k for whatever and not need it. It was fun learning the stock market and checking my accounts. BUT then I moved to material stuff and now thats dead. Cars ,gold ,diamonds ,clothes motorcycles. FOOOD!  But even thats boring now. I make about 200k a year. And youre right. Material things do not cut it lol I mean shit helps kind of but cant be happy or enjoy it when youre high, alone or single. Or all three lol. I dont have many friends anymore. Not because I burned anyone but because i was burned or stabbed in the back. And Im not talking about  using friends  talking about regular friends . Then if you think about relationships man its awful. Can never move forward or really be real or happy with someone for fear of them judging you or looking at you differently. and thats just the tip of the ice berg. I want to be off the dope so bad man. Im finally wanting a life and a family. Shit makes me sad man. So selfish. How the fuck did I let this shit happen. Ive beaten anything and everything.

"Passages is a good rehab but check to see if ur insurance covers it as its $30k for 30 days. I know they have a contract with Kaiser and the out of pocket is either zero or a small copay. Blue Shield or Blue Cross copay is about $5k unless u wait later on in the year when uve met ur copay maximum. Then its zero. Its in SoCal. I worked at the Ventura location but was actually in Port Hueneme. Obviously not as nice as the one in Malibu but that one costs $80-130k cuz patients get personal assistants and are driven around in range rovers. Possibly even have the privilege of petting a horse. LoL the one in ventura has enough room for about 50 patients. I think their current census is in the 30s. It is however in a building that used to be a childrens psych ward and skilled nursing facility so dont expect paradise. The techs are super cool. And theres a psych dr who is famous and his site is psychonabike.com. Theres definitely no tolerance for anyone bringing in drugs. Do they make it in, sometimes. Ppl seem to throw them over the fence. At Malibu they throw the over the fence in tennis balls. More temptation over there. And the Port Hueneme one was by the navy base so you will always hear them tooting their horns in the early AM and evening when the sun goes down. Also, its a few blocks by the beach. Their therapy is top notch. They keep u busy from 8-5pm. TVs in every room. U can try getting a single room but will likely cost u about $200-$400 more. Theres only one hall which I called Mahogany Lane. U tend to isolate in those rooms which isnt good. But its nice to have a roommate as ur able to discuss things and make a friend. Eventually after detox and good programming, u get transferred to a room on the 2nd floor. A bit more freedom but noisy floors. They will be checking on u every 15min during detox then every 30min the rest of the time. No getting out of it. Hope this helps! Oh and as far as attending programming the first few days of detox, theyre lenient. Theyll tell u about it but wont give u a hard time cuz ur obviously detoxing. But after a few days, they expect u at programming. If u dont attend, theyll tell ur insurance company and insurance will have u kicked out. Always report symptoms if u want to stay longer cuz they let insurance know. Never say Im fine. They will cut u down to one week. ",2022-03-13T17:52:53+00:00,30s,"craving, fear"

"Two points.  First, why are paying for pressed 30s when its the same thing if not less than a $5 bag of dope? I mean economically makes no sense. Two, get in a program like methadone or suboxone. I was on methadone continuously for a few years before getting sent back to jail and getting detoxed off immediately (why jails do this Ill never understand ). But yeah when I got out I got on suboxone and both are great. I relapsed twice on methadone and it still did its job and most likely saved my life while anyone who didnt take MAT is dead from ODs. Getting into either program and you wont wake up sick. Youll feel normal. Then you can make decisions. Even the most forgiving of parents will eventually hit their breaking point, so showing some goodwill is imperative. And in a MAT program youll be able to do group with others like you.  AA/NA wasnt for me. Im not religious and I feel their attitude towards MAT is a vestigial from the days when we thought lobotomies were okay. Plus, he wasnt a doctor, rather a use car salesman. But its a personal choice. Even if your parents havent called the cops on you that doesnt mean that you wont be arrested. So I would get into some sort of program/treatment while you figure things out before you get a serious record. I have a felony now for an $80 bundle of dope (days worth of drugs).

Yep this is all true come off/come down off the Adderall with a little bud and bennzos and go to sleep.  With the subs u need to slowly step down. Idk how much u take but if your taking two strips a day start talking one 1 every other day till u even out then go down to 1 strip a day.  U can even start skipping a day hear and there throughout the process.  Then once your on 1 strip a day u need to do the same as before start taking 1/2 strip every other day so 1 strip Then 1/2 strip Then 1 strip .   Them after a while u go to a half a strip everyday Then keep steeping down as about till your taking a 1/4 a day and u can switch to the 2mg straps and restart the step-down process u can keep stepping till u get to an 1/8 a strip a day Then down to a 1/16 strip a day Then you'll be as close to be ready to make the jump.  Once u make the jump u can still use and are going to need thw benzos to help ease the sub withdrawals and hp u sleep at night and cut the anxiety out.  Then once that's over u need to try to slowly ween your self off the benzos in a similar fashion but when u get towards the end u might need to check yourself in somewhere or can even not even start to wean the benzos down yourself and go straight to a facility to help with that. But u definitely don't want to try to wean them all down at the same time and definitely don't go cold turkey on it all cause it'll kill u.  It's best to do once at a time.  The coffee is no big deal and the cannabis can help ease the withdrawal systems coming off both these substances and once your detoxed off the major ones u can just stop the weed cause it doesn't give u withdrawals atleast not nothing u would even notice after going through the months maybe years to get off these other substances but slow and steady is what u want to where it only slight manageable detox uncomfortable feeling.  Going slow won't run u into the mud but have u slightly off and not 100% bur it could alot worse and u have to look forward to that rainbow of when you'll be free and clear of these demons on your back ,2022-04-24T09:24:30+00:00,"Adderall, bud, bennzos, subs, benzos, sub, benzos, benzos, coffee, cannabis, weed","sleep, anxiety"
"Hey, haven't checking in, in quite some time. I am a few days from 10 months clean.  Things have been rough lately. I am depressed. I knew this time of year was going to be challenging for me. I usually get seasonal depression, I haven't been able to go for my walks much in the past few months.    Just been very down, but up other days, I am not finding joy in many things. I think the ""newness"" of sobriety has worn off. I do think my brain is fucked a bit, and still working out a proper equilibrium. I don't think I am getting much dopamine. I tried Adderall for the first time a week or so ago. I didn't like it at first, but took it like 4 days in a row and I ended up enjoying it and recreating the exact behavior I used to do with opiates. Glad I only had the 5. I just had them sitting around for 2 years so I figured I'd try them. That was a mistake. Anyways, I definitely have thought about using the past few weeks. The memory of how good they felt, is strong, and the memory of how shitty it also made me feel is distant at the same time. I know logically that I can't and all the steps I'd have to do in order to relapse and the issues it would cause are not worth it. But my new reality isn't great, even though if you look on paper I should be very happy. But I am just not.    I am hoping when the weather turns and gets warm, I will snap out of this, or maybe things will just lift on their own. I know it can take a couple years for my brain to work this shit out.

"100 mg per day? first I've never really heard of Advil or ibuprofen making opiates stronger unless you are actually treating pain so drop those if you aren't.  if all you have is oxy you should try to taper with that - slowly reduce the dose while taking longer between doses, slowly towards 0mg so the detox will be as comfortable as possible.  and you'll have some discomfort, particularly if you have to quit straight up for some reason, but you'll be ok.  if you have to quit cold turkey try to find another safe and comfortable place to do it, if not tell your parents you are sick for some other reason.  but tapering works.  keep a record of how much you are taking, and try to stretch out the intervals as much as you can while lowering a little every day or two, so that you never quite get to severe withdrawals.

"Ashwaganda is a supplement, an old school Indian herb, it reduces stress and anxiety. Can help with sleep, restlessness, anxiety, irritability, mood and many other things. I never used it during withdrawals but people swear by it. I used it now for stress/sleep.  The withdrawals are not worse from suboxone, they just last longer. Suboxone has a 3 day half life, so it just builds and builds in your system until it reaches its ceiling effect. That's why there's really no reason to take over 8mg/day.  If you are prescribed subs you can take your taper as slow as you want though. Its nice to be able to do it without suboxone because no one wants to be addicted to another substance but I couldn't have made it through withdrawals without it. I had a pretty severe heroin addiction and even with suboxone I wanted to die that first week. Because of the long half life if you just jump off suboxone you can be miserable for weeks or months. That's why having a long tapering process is so important.  Lots of people do painless tapers from suboxone.

IIRC Lorazepam has a decent half life too and works for a while (8-10 hours or so I think)  That will be extremely helpful for WD. Extremely.  However its also very addictive and you need to be careful using it for longer than 2-3 days in succession.  If you think physical opiate WDs are bad.. they're nothing compared to physical Benzo WDs. So be super careful. I'm not trying to scare you off using it as required for WD, but it'd be straight up irresponsible to recommend a benzo without warning someone about the HELL that is benzo WD. It'll be fine to take for a short term period in therapeutic doses just try to only use it when required and if you find that you've used it for two or three days straight, force yourself to take a day or two off.

"Did BTH IV for about 4 months then started mixing fent/BTH for another 3 months then did a 3 day taper   with a couple dirty30s I forgot I had and then CT for about 16 days and for me it was pretty rough. Decided to long taper kratom on day 17 which has been smooth sailing for the most part ever since. The intensity and duration of withdrawals is gonna be based on the ratio of H/Fent you were using. Smoking is maybe 30% of the bioavailability that IV has so even though we used similar amounts you will probably have considerably less severe wds than me. days 1-2 were high anxiety/Hot/cold sweats mostly  Day 3-6 Was the initial ""peak"" of the physical acute withdrawals (RLS, insomnia, lower back pain, sneezing constantly, pins and needles, existential dread and little or no real functionality.) Day 7-12 it got slightly better in some ways but I didn't sleep at all so the insomnia really amplified the discomfort. The pictures on my walls were moving like gifs/animation non stop. Mentally felt paper thin and just trying to stay calm one hour at a time. RLS eased up a bit thanks to magnesium-glycinate(game changer) but back pain got worse(very tense) massage and hot showers provided temporary relief, functionality still very low. Was starting to really believe I wasnt going to recover and that I was gonna be bedridden for months. Depression/full on existential crisis... Felt very cold with waves of uncomfortable heat.  Day 13 I was finally so tired I was able to take 20mg melotonin and got like 3-4 hours of deep REM sleep after  which was the turning point I needed. Woke up feeling about 20%-30% better with a much better mindset. Started being able to walk outside a little bit and get sun. Vision seemed wonky and light felt rather intense. Still random waves of cold sweats and back pain.  Day 14-16 started really feeling some optimism... Like maybe I wasn't doomed after all. Still very low energy tho. Still very uncomfortable but there's a definite sense that the symptoms were finally fading.  Day 17 started taking small increments kratom 1-2g per hour until I felt... Ok. Not high or even normal just enough to I could kinda forget about the discomfort and get a ""break"" from the whole situation. Took about 5 grams to get right and the effects lasted about 3-4 hours. Decided I wanted to do a long taper with kratom so I could get out and be around friends and have the energy to take care of myself better/work.  Kinda wish I had used kratom the whole time but I was afraid it was gonna prolong wds and kinda just wanted to get through the worst of it quick while also feel the full agony of my habit. I think it's real easy to forget how brutal wds really were later on so I wanted to really burn it into my brain that heroin caused this and it wasn't the ""savior"" I like to think it is when I'm having cravings. Started taking between ~30-50gpd kratom but wasn't weighing it for the first month and found my self taking more and more and actually starting to get actual euphoria for a couple hours after each dose. Spaced out dosages as long as I could and really felt Soo much better. Around the beginning of March I started weighing my doses again and realized I had increased my daily to about 60g/day so after that I started using condiment cups to measure out 6 individual doses of 7g and made a little stack for each day. Took a week to stabilize at 45 then dropped to 40  so each week is 5 grams less . Now at 20gpd and feel good about it. About 75 days no H/Fent. I've had a few drug dreams but I really feel like I'm done. When I think about it I remember the WDS more than the high so I really don't feel that tempted anymore... I've accepted that ""strategic use"" of heroin is a pipe dream so it's just perma-banned from my life.  Got a little carried away writing this but I wanted to save it myself in case I ever needed a reminder down the road. Hit me up if you ever need to talk or get bored. You got this brother. Look at it as a challenge you are choosing to do as opposed to something thats ""happening"" to you and itll feel way less scary. It's more mental than physical.

"How much Benadryl did u take? Each is 25mg. There was one OTC medication I took many yrs ago that helped me sleep. It was called SleepMD. I got it at my local Walgreens at that time. It helped tremendously! Its all natural. Melatonin is also good. We tend to prescribe 3-10mg of melatonin to help kick in with ur natural melatonin. Try it with some cold/warm milk at night. If its past 1pm and u havent slept, try to stay awake until ur next bedtime. Dont take naps. That way when its time to sleep at night, ur able to stay asleep throughout the night and wake up with the rest of the world. Melatonin resets ur sleep cycle.

Going to the clinic just makes you a slave to something else. You have to call them to schedule when they can bring you in for intake if they aren't full. Then you have to get yourself there daily in the morning. If you are running late and get there even 1 minute after they close in the morning they will not help you.

I'd I got xlsN from my medication entirely  my quality of life would without a doubt have me on disability and needing even more mental health treatment r sue to the misery from life quality. So....

I have encountered so many xlena people even on this site alone, that sure they are clean from mesa. Whoopsidoo. Not clean. From being an asshole tho.

People that  behave that way have surely indirectly caused relapse in others due to their toxic  communication.

And insisting that because I used to use real opiates then I shouldn't be allowedto function physically. None of the people that have spoken to me that way are working a recovery  that is above mine somehow. It's ignorant.

It's the smoothest detox you're going to get. Its like a walk in the park compared to cold turkey. They use ibogaine it's a psychoactive plant medicine (its a trip) but it also treats opiate withdrawal.  Success rates with this for getting through detox are. 80-95 % to get through the detox which is way better than regular detox methods. There is a bit of a wait list.. so you should contact them ASAP brother. Look I know two weeks is a lot and $10,000 may feel like a lot but over a year you're going to save the money you'd be spending on pills anyhow. And you very well may save your life. Inner Realms in Canada. The guy there is extremely experienced in Ibogaine treatments , it's one of the only places in Canada still doing the Ibogaine opiate detoxs. they titration between ibogaine and morphine whe you're there so you're not just going cold turkey, they wean you with high doses of oral morphine and ibogaine  I seriously recommend contacting them getting in touch with Garret or Garryth his names something like that.  I am seriously considering going if they stop the domestic travel bans on unvaccinated.  I'm in Canada and we aren't allowed to fly within our own country being unvaccinated.  I realize that stopping is only half the battle and I would encourage you to work on some sort of healthy lifestyle plan for coming home like getting hooked up with yoga and consider going to NA or some sort of place for support. Maybe start exercising, get a therapist or something for a period of time once you get back - you don't have to tell anybody about the therapy.  And you could just pretend you're going on vacation for 2 weeks. it's seriously the best route for dealing with a heavy opiate dependence but most people can't afford $10,000 for 2 weeks of Ibogaine detoxing. You'll also  learn about yourself Ibogaine is a interesting plant medicine and you'll gain insights about yourself. And at the end of the detox you'll take 5-MEO-DMT which is another plant medicine which is also healing.  Inner Realms in British Columbia Canada. Contact Garryt or Garryth I forget the name but tell him what's going on tell him you want to get off fentanyl and ask about the opiate detox. even if you don't want to stop using you could do this to get fentanyl out of your system and then start using actual pharmaceuticals instead of the fake pressees.

"Everyone has an opinion- but I wouldn't beat myself up over 30 - 120mg of Codeine as a maintenance situation. 28 or 30 or 60 a day is so light as to hardly even register. You cannot be ""addicted"" in the true sense at these levels. Sure, you are addicted like one is to coffee or a glass or two of wine, but not addicted in a true sense. And, if it helps you live better and feel better - codeine in that amount should do no damage to your body or mind (IMHO, someone can correct me). If it works for you, you could switch to tramadol - which some would call a ""lighter"" addictive type - it may constipate less (you can fix that anyway w/popcorn, dates, prunes, etc.). I am giving you an older perspective. I worked in construction much of my life and in my late 60's I enjoy being VERY active. Small amounts, in the realms you are discussing, help me be happier (physically - and therefore mentally). Plus, since I can be more active, that stimulates me and makes me healthier.  To each their own. I have at least 20 years experience doing Codeine in those amounts - and I have stopped and moved to tramadol (or nothing) with nothing more than perhaps 2 days of a bad mood.

"Sometimes my WD's are different,  one time I was kicking DHC and Oxy and like you I was fine the first 2 entire days. Whereas normally  12 hours after my last dose I'll start feeling the sickness heavy, and 24 hours after my last dose I'll be in full blown dopesickness. But this one and only time, the first 2 days I was totally fine, barely felt the WD, chilled and watched TV.  But then it hit midnight on the end of the 2nd day and man the WD hit me HARD, that night was agony my skin was burning, major chills, all the rest. I made it until the morning of day 4 and snapped and relapsed. But yeah ever since then, I've never had it where the first 2 days were fine. Next WD it went back to being 12 hours is where the sickness starts and 24 hours full on dopesick.   And I was getting legit pharma stuff.  Are you sure yours are legit as fentadope / M30's, (if you are buying from the streets in the USA they are almost certainly fake no matter if your cousin says he ""saw them come out of the pharmacy bro they good"")  so fentadope can take 3 days to even start. But if you are in Europe you don't have to worry about fent being in them. Mine were the Sandoz 80's / 40's I imagine you probably have similar or the mundipharma ones. I hope you get lucky  but for me each consecutive detox is worse if I went back on 320mg a day (I was doing 480mg so similar to yours)  for 2 weeks,  I'd have full blown dopesickness  just like kicking a year of daily use. But I've had so many detoxes now  WD wipes me out.

Pot has helped me. Psilocybin has helped too. But one of the biggest game changers was DMT. You need to be careful with it. In Canada it's pretty much legal now.

"The top few posts really cover a lot of the most important stuff but I didn't see it mentioned so I will add.. DXM. It's OTC and low doses are FANTASTIC for reducing WD symptoms. You can google it as they've even done studies that prove it reduces WD in addicts.  60mg 3 or 4 times a day is what I would usually use during a kick. It also synergizes strongly with Pregabalin so I imagine it would also produce good results with Gabapentin. Not that I'm saying get high of course, but those two would be excellent in making WD bearable.  I've also tried higher more recreational sized DXM doses for WD and they were hit and miss. Some times the disso effect would kinda make it possible to not feel most WD, other times it added extra anxiety and stimulation which you don't want.  I'd recommend 30-60mg 2-4 times a day or as required. It is an absolute lifesaver for me. Promethazine was also helpful for the histamine effects though I'm sure an antihistamine would do, if you go a gen-1 it will also have some sedative qualities which I find help.  Good luck dude. Stay hydrated, avoid the darvocet as much as you can as while it will help short term, it will prolong the overall amount of time you're gonna spend in WD, especially if you take it say.. 2 or 3 days after starting cold turkey, it'll likely reset those 3 days and we don't want that mate, best wishes! Edit: given you wanted to hear it all, here is my list of tried comfort meds and a rating: ANYTHING with opiate activity: Immediately contradicted. Promethazine/Diphenhydramine: 7/10. Super helpful with runny nose/eyes and other histamine based issues. DXM 9/10: truly helpful. Alleviates certain symptoms I thought only opiates could frankly. Low dose only.  Diazepam 8/10: super helpful, super addictive.. not worth trading one habit for another especially not Benzos, but very helpful in moderation.  Xanax: similar to above with worse rebound effects. Really it applies for all benzos.  Clonidine: 10/10. Not recreational and extremely helpful with the physical symptoms. Can't recommend enough if you have access. Start with low dose and work your way up. Too much will FLOOR you and not in a good way.  Seroquel/Anti-psychs: 3/10. Not worth it IMO. Might help you sleep but might not.. then your stuck in chemical handcuffs feeling extra mentally disabled.  Carisoprodol (Soma) 10/10: Withdrawal? What's that? I don't even know my fucking name right now. Very very addictive. I don't actually recommend due to the addictiveness but they definitely helped.  Phenobarbital: 9/10 extremely helpful for sleep and sedation of overstimulation. Not recreational which curbs abuse risk. Almost impossible to acquire in most places.  Vitamin C: 3/10 the science is out on this one. BUT it can't hurt and might help. Pregabalin: 10/10 my gold standard. It's extremely helpful with withdrawal but also quote addictive and daily use has a nasty hangover.  Gabapentin 8/10: Better than nothing and similar to pregabalin. I don't see it much but I don't say no when I do.  Microdosed Psilocybin: Not helpful during acute withdrawal.  HOWEVER in the week after.. I found microdosing profoundly helpful to ponder on my future, my drug use and what I'd do now I was not a slave to the ball and chain. It was profoundly helpful for me personally but YMMV.  Alcohol: 0/10. Made everything insanely worse.  Marijuana: ... Can be a 8/10 or a 0/10. Weed is the grand sensitizer.. feel like shit and its very likely to just exacerbate that.. sometimes it doesn't and it helps greatly. Too much of a coin flip to recommend. Though I personally smoke like a train in WD.  Uppers: 1/10. Short term helpful for the depression and fatigue but then you have to come down. Mixed upper comedown with opiate WD is hands down the worst shit ever and has resulted in my only visits to hospital for drug abuse. Getting overloaded on meth because I couldn't score H and ""needed a fix""... Foolish foolish choice that was.. 5 day insomniac perpetual panic attack + junk sick.. EDIT Forgot other NDMA agonists (they all in theory can help)  Ketamine: 5/10 Low doses were helpful. 20-40mg bumps as required certainly took my mind off the WD, especially in combination with diazepam, though that's not a particularly safe combo so I wouldn't recommend it. I'd doubt a K-Hole would be too fun on K. It's also a little too short acting for my tastes. It's main use is the analgesia and disassociation numbing the feeling of WD I found. Can exacerbate anxiety though.  Orphenadrine: 11/10 a ""dirty drug"" with Muscle Relaxant, Anticholinergic, Analgesic and NDMA agonist effects. Extremely extremely helpful for WD, one of the few drugs that has got rid of the stiff calf muscles I find I always get in WD. Has a lot of interactions so is contradicted if your on a various bevy of pharmaceuticals. Is safe with most listed comfort meds in therapeutic doses. Abusing it just results in Delerium so that's super helpful for never abusing it. I wish I could still get this stuff.  Memantine (may have spelt wrong) in theory could be helpful for acute WD. Is very long acting. Haven't tried.  MXE: a longer acting relative of Ketamine. To me it always sounded like it would be better for WD than Ket. Never got to try it. Nitrous Oxide: actually quite helpful but self limited due to B12 effects. You can essentially binge on it for one day of your WD then you really should not touch it for a long unless you want to risk a severe, legitimately crippling B12 deficiency. PCP.. in theory.. it could help.. in practice you could become Buck Ravers the naked junk sick diarrhoea covered rambling freak in the local lockup.. probably don't bother.  RANDOM OTHER DRUGS TRIED IN WD MDMA: Horrible. Comedown was double suicidal depression. 0/10.  Acid: No. No. No. No. In PAWS. It's quite decent. But when sick. No. No rating due to this.  DMT: Same as above.  High CBD edibles: Pretty helpful. Too much THC isn't always good. CBD is helpful though. 7/10.  Naproxen: 6/10: helpful for pain and swelling.  Paracetamol: 2/10: helpful for headache, fever and advancing liver failure.  Scoplamine: No.  Ibogaine: Can't get it where I am but look into it if your into experimental treatments.

It depends how long you were using. A cute withdrawal from Dilaudid is fairly short. You should be ok in 2 weeks. But there is also the possibility you will develop post acute withdrawal (PAWs). This can last for months. Exercise and diet can help. Treat the depression as you would any form of depression. If it gets really bad you could consider medication.

"Dxm in addition to clonodine is the perfect combo. This is just a snipit from an article I read about a study of clonodine bs dxm and clonodine for withdrawal symptoms of opiate addiction.  Background. Dextromethorphan is a noncompetitive N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonist that is clinically feasible for relieving the opioid withdrawal symptoms. This study compares the efficacy of a combination therapy with dextromethorphan and clonidine to treatment with clonidine alone.Methods and Materials. In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, patients were selected from inpatients of detox and rehabilitation ward of Razi Hospital, Tabriz, Iran. They were randomly allocated to two groups receiving either clonidine (0.41.2mg/day) or clonidine and dextromethorphan (300mg/day). Withdrawal symptoms were evaluated in the first day of admission and again 24, 48, and 72 hours later.Results. Thirty male patients completed the trial in each group. Withdrawal symptoms began to decrease in the second day in patients receiving dextromethorphan and clonidine while patients receiving clonidine experienced the more severe symptoms in 72 hours. Analysis of variance of the symptom severity score revealed a significant grouptime interaction (;), so that patients receiving dextromethorphan plus clonidine had milder symptoms during three days in all of the measurements compared to clonidine group.Conclusion. Combination therapy of dextromethorphan and clonidine would result in milder opioid withdrawal symptoms compared to clonidine alone with a reduction beginning at the second day.

"I appreciate the responses - thanks for your help   I managed to get an appointment with a different support worker and they've started my official reduction with me. Once I've gotten down as far as 2mg Espranor they're going to swich me over to 2mg subutex as the higher bioavailabilty of the espranor means that this is still a lesser dose. I'll then be reduced in 0.4 increments from there. As I've already started tapering myself and just went down to 1.5mg after getting prescribed 2mg wafers yesterday, I'll be able to stay on the smaller amounts for longer. So glad I managed to get this plan put in place whilst my normal worker's absent and as it was her boss I met with, I doubt she'd change it once she returns. It's quite frustrating how little the staff I've dealt with understand this medication though.

Luckily, I'll be able to take it at my own pace and listen to my own body to decide when it's levelled out enough to take each step.

From my too much experience on this exact position you are in. You need to wait 72 hours. Im at day 6 of the same habit you had. Fent withdrawal doesnt fully hit u till 72 hours even tho you still feel shitty before then but 35 hours you are not even in withdrawal yet and still definitely have fent on your receptors. Subs wont touch your tolerance until like 96 hours and even then it will barely help you. Takes away the most severe symptoms for me but I'm still extremely ill with the subs until day 4 and even then they dont do much. I took 16 mg of subs from hours 72 to 120. I havent had anything in about 30 hours now and I'm still a slug and feel like shit but I'm a tad better than I was. So I'm hoping I can feel better and better from this point on.  Good luck trying to fight this demon of hell!

"I stopped off a 2g a day Fentynal habit 3 or 4 times.  I would wait until day 3 to take a sub because of a bad experience with precipitated withdrawals.  The last time I quit, I snorted 3gs within 2 hours hoping to kill myself because I honestly had lost hope of being clean, and withdrawals terrify me.  I'm only 150 days sober, and honestly just beginning to have days where I feel normal.  With all that said, I'm glad I lived and am glad I'm sober.   Imodium is an opiate, and I would take 16 a day the first week.  I took Kava, valerian root, edibles, and Tylenol pretty steady for the week as well.  I took my first sub a few days before I got clean, prolly saved my life, but I suggest that.  I'm still on Suboxone now, but I took 3 a day for 3 months and in the last month I'm down to 1.  That was a little tough too, but mostly just super tired, not the shaking and quaking of dope.  I despised subs and never wanted to get addicted to them, and honestly it and weed are the only things that kept me off the dope for an extended period of time.  I pay $180 for a telemedicine visit and $90 for 90 subs, so basically $280 a month without insurance.  I had what I hope is my last meeting yesterday, and plan to use the 90 to be off Subs in 3 months.  There's no shame in subs, and if you have the willpower to stop dope bud, you've got the will power to stop subs.  I never thought I'd be normal again, but I feel hopeful for the first time in 3,4 years and I'm telling you it's worth whatever suffering you have to endure to get here.

I managed to get a full ride to college and by the grace of god kept my scholarships so after that I didnt have to deal with the hustle but life hasnt gotten easier lol.  Not unusual at all either.

And they didnt all get that after they were sober. They were ripping and running when they got it.  Thing is, that stuff doesnt make you happy man. And even if you manage to get all the material things AND all the other things like good relationships, work life balance, etc., drugs will still take the happiness away from you.

To start with you have a great assortment of detox meds especially the Gaba and kratom. Both of which should really be helping just d ont go overboard and take those forever instead. If it was only 3 weeks you should be just starting to go over the peak of the worst of it and will have noticable improvement each day. By the time you have work in 5 days you should be ok enough to muster up the strength to do it as long as it isn't like hardcore outdoor construction or something. I am in a similar situation right now so I feel you. Also what is going to make a big difference for getting you ready to face life again in a few days. Is making yourself eat and drink as much good food as possible. And getting light exercise. Like walking as far as you feel comfortable maybe light jog in another day or 2. The more you do the more you will feel accomplished and good afterwards. Keep going bro dont give up and d ont ever go back after this.

Clonadine - Alpha-2 antagonist was scared of it at first but can help tremendously just watch BP Tizanidine - Alpha-2 antagonist muscle relaxer sleep aid Mirtazapine - incorrectly listed as an SNRI on my chart below apparently it is a TeCA but also a Alpha-2 antagonist antidepressant but used alot for sleep. lofexidine - Alpha-2 antagonist good luck pretty much same as Clonadine with a huge price tag attached not sure if it's even avaliable in the states yet. guanfacine - Alpha-2 antagonist haven't found source of yet. methyldopa - Alpha-2 antagonist haven't found sourse yet. Memantine - NMDA antagonist extreamly long lasting manageable dissociative. Dextromethorphan - NMDA antagonist enjoyable must have for me but doesn't last long. Ketamine - NMDA antagonist I use a legal analog for this called 2-FDCK short lasting snorting is u plesent and a waste must take oral or rectal . Not a huge fan yet snorted or oral. Admantine - NMDA antagonist have taken with other nmdas but had to tell when you taking like 20 different things. It's anti malaria and may protect against covid-19. Orphenadrine - NMDA antagonist but also muscle relaxer? Haven't found source. Dextroamphetamine - surprisingly is an NMDA antagonist and tons of people says it helps immensely but I am not much into uppers... Venlafaxine - SNRI antidepressant, not a fan of antidepressants unless occasionally for sleep. Mirtazapine - listed as an SNRI on my chart below apparently it is a TeCA but also a Alpha-2 antagonist antidepressant but used alot for sleep.

Supplements (paragraphed section not originally written by me) DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA): Up to 2,000 mg, three times daily, one hour before meals. DL-phenylalanine, an amino acid, inhibits the enzyme enkephalinase, which breaks down endorphins and enkephalins at the receptor site. Please remember that if you are taking any antidepressant medication, you should consult a healthcare professional before taking phenylalanine. L-Leucine: Up to 500 mg, three times daily, one hour before meals. The amino acid leucine is required for the production of enkephalins. L-Methionine: Up to 500 mg, three times daily, one hour before meals. The amino acid methionine is required for the production of enkephalins. L-Glycine: Up to 2,000 mg with each dose of DLPA. Glycine is an amino acid that helps in relaxation, and it is essential to the synthesis of endorphins and enkephalins. L-Tyrosine: 2,000 mg, twice per day. The amino acid tyrosine is required for the production of enkephalins. Multi-Mineral Supplement: Make sure that your mineral supplement contains the following, and take enough tablets each day to roughly equal the following dosages: calcium, 1,000 mg; magnesium, 300 mg; potassium, 100 mg; iron, 20 mg; zinc, 20 mg; manganese, 6 mg; copper, 1 mg; chromium, 400 mcg; selenium, 60 mcg; molybdenum, 50 mcg. L-theanine for some safe, non habit-forming relaxation. Vitamin B-5 (now 1000mg a day) - For cortisol & the adrenals. Cortisol is strongly anti-inflammatory. B-5 will keep your cortisol in check. First time I took 1500mg of B-5 I noticed a serious drop in the intensity of my pain. Berberine: By far an incredible alkaloid! A very bitter, medicine tasting alkaloid. Can be bought at health stores. I'm no expert on Berberine but I have read around 20 studies just on this 1 compound. It's somehow related to opiates. It actually feels a bit like a really small dose of suboxone. Take it with black pepper. The berberine bridge seems to moderate morphine production in your cells, it kills pain, reduces anxiety, gives me an endorphin like energy all day long & it's natural because it's in a certain type of grape (and other things). It also reduces blood sugar & cholesterol. I love this stuff and did I say it really helps for pain? (if you react well with it which most people seem to): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526741/ Glucosamine / Chondroitin / MSM: I'm not going to say much about this. It's been overmarketed, has too much to talk about & the onset of action is slow. Agmatine is the king of opiate withdrawal treatment btw. it directly releases endorphins via the imidazoline receptor and treats opiate withdrawals in humans and lab animals alike. thanks for sharing and gl in your getting clean Curcumin So I know there are different forms and the higher end are longvida, meriva, therac..or something, and 95 something.

"Gabapentin actually absorbs less and less the higher the single dose goes. You have to titrate 3grams, aka take 600mg every 20 to 30 mins if you have no gabapentin tolerance. It legit is one of my favorite drugs after figuring that out, and also that fat also will increase absorption by a decent bit. Orally administered gabapentin exhibits saturable absorption  a nonlinear (zero-order) process  making its pharmacokinetics less predictable. Plasma concentrations of gabapentin do not increase proportionally with increasing dose. In contrast, orally administered pregabalin is absorbed more rapidly, with maximum plasma concentrations attained within 1 hour. Absorption is linear (first order), with plasma concentrations increasing proportionately with increasing dose. The absolute bioavailability of gabapentin drops from 60% to 33% as the dosage increases from 900 to 3600 mg/day, while the absolute bioavailability of pregabalin remains at <-90% irrespective ofthe dosage. Some people on bluelighjt seemed to confirm this anecdotally and as someone who is prescribed large amounts of gaba daily for years now it definitely is a noticeable difference titrating it. Last time I was in rehab the brain health specialist mentioned this without me prompting a question about it (he was going over pharmacokinetics and addiction) and it was kinda cool hearing it from an established doctor who was a recovering addict as well. For me doing 900 to 1200mg titration over the course of 2 or 3 hours produces a surprisingly speedy feeling in addition to providing restlessness relief, neuropathic pain, all then other things associated with the drug. Also this is a very small study on the fat absorption thing so take this, as scientific knowledge, w a grain of salt but again I've at least had the perception that this is true, albeit titration being more important imo  Data from all subjects were used for pharmacokinetic and safety analyses unless stated otherwise. Mean (standard deviation) bioavailability (based on urinary recovery) of gabapentin from gabapentin enacarbil was 42.0 (6.1)%(fasted), 64.3 (13.2)%(low-fat meal), 64.9 (16.9)%(moderate-fat meal), and 76.1 (14.4)%(high-fat meal).

Keep your head up high man and keep doing your best to tell yourself how great your doing now vs before. ",2022-02-22T09:43:52+00:00,H,cravings
How to taper off H effectively,2022-02-23T13:25:22+00:00,H,
I agree combo of early prego symptoms and probably brain rewiring issues. I had crazy dreams at your point....people shooting me up with H (mind u only did rx and scared of needles)...like my head was trying to tell me I needed something. I am over 2 months and at this point I am sleeping normal etc. I do still have bouts of anxiety and am much more quiet than I used to be. But I look at it as part of process and what I gotta go through. Doesn't make it easy....just gives it purpose. And yes baby in tummy....please stay strong. I've posted on here before I took care of baby from drug addict mom who was adopted by my family. It was not easy or right in any way.  You can do this and will get through this. ,2022-03-28T13:48:59+00:00,H,anxiety
"YUP! it's not you. It's the drug. It's synthetic so after only 1-2weeks either you bump the tolerance up alot or deal with just feeling normal. Ironic right? We take drugs to feel a high so we don't feel normal, only to have to take the drug to only feel normal, something we ran from. If you ask me, that's the devil's bargain... And the devil's drug. I miss H ;( ",2022-04-21T20:55:30+00:00,H,
"Totally depends on what it really is and how much of what is in it. I was once addicted to far more, for example, but it completely depends on the purity level. Also, for example, I knew others who did the same F/H I did in far lower amounts (like a g or .5 a day), but they were still just as sick without it. ",2022-02-23T21:09:40+00:00,H,
"Ah, ok now I get it. I thought you were pointing out how strong your H is. Bupe is hella strong. Your dosages are low, but not crazy low. First time I did bupe was only a few weeks into my heroin addiction. Was only snorting a quater gram per day. I did 4mg subutex and it got me high. I think bupe works less good the more often you use it to taper off. ",2022-03-25T01:27:04+00:00,"H, Bupe, bupe, heroin, subutex, bupe",
Ya I do understand what your saying.. I have also seen the other side of it. I have a little brother that was born addicted to H and Crk. I was 18 when I went and saw him in the incubator and it was horrible watching him shake. He now has some developmental delays but he is still  an amazing loving child. However I have also known other people that have done drs the whole pregnancy and their children are completely normal. It really depends case by case. I found the best doctor I could go to that deals with this and they said only children that the mothers take things off and on and dont receive any medical treatment during pregnancy face difficulties. Thankfully I am pregnant after being sober for a few years and take my medication regularly and monitored. Even saying that Im not judging any moms out there that have done that .. I know how hard addiction is to beat but I pray  that any mom that is struggling gets help because it is possible. All we can do is be the best version of ourselves each day and be who we would want for our children to look up too and make a choice to change. I wanted to get off Suboxone as soon as I found out I was pregnant but my doctor told me it was unsafe. Im not sure why some of my sentences are bolder lol.

"6.75 years here, and Im gonna type a lot. Dont feel like you have to read it. Im just gonna put it here. . if you stay away from the substance it gets Simpler? I dont want to say easier, but definitely simpler. Your mind calms down, you start finding joy in things that you never knew you even liked. Then you start realizing that joy is actually a thing, and things become fuller. Nothing is easy in this reality, unfortunately and I dont know why that is but its OK because you have support if you want it. My sobriety has been Nothing I thought it would be when I first entered it. When I got clean, I was terrified of my need for my drug. Need, it was like air for me. I suffocated without it.  I rolled over in bed and shot up every morning, I didnt eat without shooting up, I didnt shit without shooting up, I didnt breathe without shooting up. How was I supposed to live?  I didnt know how to take a shower and be comfortable in my own body without drugs. I would spend days, weeks on binges. If it wasnt H, it was benzos, and when I really wanted to act like a fool I would smoke as much meth as I could get my hands on and then take benzos so I wouldnt feel guilty for the sexual or violent things I knew was going to do.  something about Somaa and Xanax, I think its because it was like dying without actually dying. My brain ceased to exist when I took those together.  Id find myself in hotel rooms, repeatedly obsessively counting my pills or weighing my shit. I was really far gone. The day I went to treatment for the second time, was the day I was going to commit suicide less than 5 feet away from my three-year-old son. My dad committed suicideon Xmas when I was 10 and it ruined me..yet here I was, happily doing the same tk an innocent child. there was like 1% of the true me still holding on, and she was terrified that I was about to take this step. The 99% other side of me was ready to go. I sat there with a fat fucking shot and looked at my child and couldnt even cry. I had started using the year after I lost my father at 11 with alc and weed, so thinking about  taking the drugs away felt like losing him all over again. What the fuck was I supposed to do to cope? And it had been 15 years, so what was wrong with me??? I had these preconceived notions that had got me to that point, that disgusting point. I thought that religion/spirituality were the same thing, and it was a crutch for stupid and weak people who couldnt except that when we died, that was it. I thought that mental health medication was also a crutch, and if I was going to quit doing h, then why the hell would I trade that for something else? If I could get up in the morning and not put something in my body to function, if I could get there then what a weak person to take another medication to help with anything else. So, I again entered treatment with these ideas that I had worked so hard to create and live by for the last 25 years.  so I enter treatment and while I was in detox, this annoying meth head helped me through my first spiritual awakening. Im not like this today, but then I was very very aggressive and if you tried me, I was going to make sure you regretted it. So she was already on my nerves, she never slept and I was convinced she had snuck shit in and I wanted it. So one day when she was blabbering on, about six days into wd, I literally felt like my bones were being pulled apart by Giants, I said to her, there is no way you are this happy in recovery. You have to have shit in here somewhere? Where is it? At first she looked offended but then she said, Have you ever tried listening to anybody else? Anybody but yourself? At first I wanted to kill her, but then I realized I couldnt get out of bed without shitting myself, so I let her words sink in. I hadnt. I had not ever attempted to listen to anybody else for more than a sentence or two, only to tell them why they were wrong or it wouldnt worked.  So I told her no, and about then it was med time thank God lol,  so we were dosed with sleepy meds and out we went. Something about that next morning felt different, I woke up and took the first shower I had in probably two weeks. And this was the start of my first true sobriety run.  I was still completely oppositional for yearssss.  At around 100 days sober, after this treatment, I relapsed. I now call it a lapse because I didnt go on a binge, but I did buy some tar, and I definitely used it.  it was bizarre. Of course it was the same ..feeling, but instead of it taking me away, it just amplified everything around me. I had gotten my child back, I had a home I was trying so hard to work to pay bills for, and it was like soon as I put that needle in my arm all of reality got turned up by 100 times. I was so fucking ashamed. And because I had actually started listening to people, I realized that this was the beginning of a shame cycle that I needed to put the end to that moment. If I didnt, I was going to die, and my son was going to feel what I felt 1 million times over. Which also made me feel shameful, but now I had some tools. I called some other sober people, we went and got ice cream, and I bawled my fucking eyes out.  This is when I threw myself into any type of recovery program I could, religious-based, spiritual-based, scientific-based. At first it was a joke to me, like everything is but eventually I really started listening to those other people. Over the last seven-ish years I have learned that my aggressive angry persona is actually a secondary emotion usually due to intense anxiety/fight or flight or some other emotion like a betrayal/pain/shame/ridicule. My anger is always a secondary emotion.  Ive learned that even if I have an explosive moment due to fear, it is not hypocritical to go back and apologize or change my behavior. I had to make a lot of amends in the beginning, because I constantly fucked shit up. I was so depressed and so mean.  which then led me into realizing my self talk was absolutely atrocious. No wonder I was so mean to other people, I dont think  I called myself anything but a dumb bitch.  A Therapist wants told me that I can say 120 words per minute, but I think 1200 words per min in my head, so they had better be good. That was astounding when I finally started listening to what I said to myself, instead of just taking my thoughts as my identity. Today I know that thats come and go and I dont have to attach myself to any of them. I can have an immediate reaction to a situation, but I dont have to express it. I can feel my feelings, let them rise and fall, and then make a decision on how to react, instead of impulsive reactions that got me to where I was.  I now understand that my intense hatred for religion was very very valid, and spirituality and religion are two very different things.  I dont have to live in fear of hell or in fear of a higher power that wants to smite me if I do something bad or wrong or if I am wrong. Heck, I dont have to live in fear of if I am wrong anymore. I thought I was so broken.  The biggest thing that has helped me find peace has been acceptance of who I am as a human. I am a daughter of a man who committed suicide, I am a recovering heroin addict, but those are not the only things. I am a kind giving person who loves deeply, and today the dichotomy of my actions dont confound me. I know that the actions I made in active addiction were symptoms of my disease. I had an undiagnosed and untreated disease of addiction, and it had run rampant. Today, I apply the appropriate treatments to my disease which are for me, lots and lots of different therapy, yoga, meditation, running, singing, AA, smart recovery, my friends and a higher power who doesnt hate me. I was one of those people who didnt believe until I saw a miracle, looking at myself in the mirror today is that miracle, as cheesy as it fucking sounds.  I am a woman of science, I know statistics and probabilities and biology, but none of that explains the happiness I know today.  Im grateful. Before, I didnt know how to be grateful for anything, and especially not my pain.  Life gets so much fuller . It doesnt get better, shit still fucking happens. My best friend OD on March 25,2019, and Ive cried about it all day today. I stayed clean though because I refuse to let him die in vain. I am learning from his loss, not wallowing in my fucking despair anymore. So tired of pitying myself and pretending like I wasnt. Its OK to accept that these things have happened, and I dont have to play the  why do all these bad things happen to me . Life on lifes terms.  I made it through all of this bullshit so that I could say its possible for others. If I help one person then Im happy.

"Lucky you actually had a plug / means to get H at 4am, I've only ever had cocaine dealers that would work around those hours. Proper trap house kinda set up or something? For a while I was grabbing off these two guys who had rented an apartment and were taking 12 hour shifts each, so they were a 24/7 operation essentially, but it was still tough to grab between 2am and 7am most nights, fucking guy would fall asleep because there just isn't much action and he'd be tired or just doze off so it wasn't reliable in the middle of the night, but these two guys made a fucking shit ton in like 2 months on this operation, they both must have profited over $1 million each because it was a CONSTANT stream of people coming in other than middle of the night and it was an affluent area and they were selling the best blow and crack and H around at the time, so they were easily selling several ounces of each every day to users + selling to other dealers several ounces at a time so maybe going through a kilo of coke, crack and H per day, something like that.  I hung around with them for like 4 days straight on a binge because I was friends with one of the two (the other guy didn't like me lol..) and I'd never seen so many drug sales constantly happening, there were line ups out the door sometimes, dealers coming in grabbing several ounces + addicts coming multiple times per day. It was nuts, and this was in a very affluent suburban area so I think once they made their money they GTFO'd to avoid the cops that were probably beginning to realize or set up a raid because they were constantly driving around this apartment buildings parking lots. Once there were about 15 people in the place at 10pm, all smoking crack, we'd literally hot boxed the place with crack smoke and a cop car drove by, never heard a place go from so loud and chaotic to sheer silence and stillness so fast, lol. Oh ya and one time, randomly this friend and other dealer of mine showed up to the place with a fucking knife and stabbed some junkie there, it was NUTS! The guy was OK, had to go to hospital but it wasn't a bad stabbing. And another time this guy robbed a gas station across the road for dope money and ran in to grab and told us what happened, and he wanted to hang out and use but they tossed his ass out because that was too much heat. It was just constant chaos really, and for a few weeks of my life I was really happy to be a part of that chaos, lol, but I was using waaaay too much in such an environment, I had to stop eventually and get on methadone again and just occasionally use blow on my own but those were some memorable weeks anyways. Any junkie in my town that I've spoken to since remembers that summer because it was so different from how suburban drug dealing usually happens, and these guys were so professional about it and moving so much good drugs, we'd just never seen that before or since really.

" Lucky you actually had a plug / means to get H at 4am, I've only ever had cocaine dealers that would work around those hours. Proper trap house kinda set up or something?  It was hit or miss with those guys. It was a group that had multiple drivers, multiple phones all running throughout the day. But it was an hour there, hour back just to grab and even then, they'd get pissy if you'd ask if they'd be good in an hour, say to call back when in the area, and then not pick up the phones when you'd get there because they'd close shop. Then you'd be sick as fuck and sit in that city for 3-4 hours calling and calling and calling until one of them woke up and got to work or you just gave up and drove home sicker than when you left the house. Not to mention ""ye papi, I got you"" just for them to not have the amount you asked for. Another friend had empathy and would usually pick up the phone if the other crew wasn't around and the ring actually woke him up. Dude saved my ass many times but once fent hit the scene heavy, his shit just wouldn't even get me well and I'd have to pay even more just to feel normal again. Very, very sweet guy. Love him to death.  they both must have profited over $1 million each because it was a CONSTANT stream of people coming in other than middle of the night   Pretty nutty how much these guys make sometimes, especially if they arent tapping into their own supply. One of my boys was flying high on my entire fuckin paycheck, would talk shit about how awful and annoying junkies were when they were sick, and then started using himself. This motherfucker went from being an asshole to saying ""ya you can have some foil for free, by the way, I'm sick can I take a hit?"" No, motherfucker. Plus, most of that money is useless if you can't find a way to launder it. Buying everything and paying rent in cash will only get you so far.

Funniest shit ever with the first crew I talked about. These dumb asses would send everyone to one location. These guys seemed like they ran the whole area, so that's a lot of people. You got two guys, two cars, two phones and they weren't communicating at all. Same locations in rotation to meet up. We pulled up one night and there are no joke like 30 crackheads and dope fiends in one parking lot- sitting on the curb, sitting on the hoods of their cars, arguing amongst each other. I stay in the fuckin car cause fuck that shit. Dude pulls up and I swear to god every single one of them surrounded his suv before I could blink. He rolled down the window and screamed for everyone to back the fuck up but everyone was ""I GOT HERE FIRST""-ing and were basically trying to all pile into the car at once. Dude should have carried a broom to smack people with. After that, guess they got in trouble with the bossman and they started sending us to the most random locations where you'd be waiting for over an hour just to call em back and hear ""ah, sorry papi, forgot about you. Be there in 10"". So much bullshit for 0 reward.  Oh ya and one time, randomly this friend and other dealer of mine showed up to the place with a fucking knife and stabbed some junkie there, it was NUTS!   That happened to one of my buddies. Pretty sure he got sticky fingers. They dumped him in an alley, he got transported to the hospital, stitched up and then the dude left because the pain meds they gave him weren't strong enough. Nutty. Also had a crackhead pistol whip my other friend. Guess dude got arrested, escaped, and first place dude goes to is my buddy's house because of a front that happened right before dude got arrested. Poor kid wasn't expecting him to show up so the dude pulled a gun on him and left him with a black eye. Same dude scared the fuck out of me when we were at the trap and he lost his crack, started blaming everyone and making us look for it. Unstable, violent crackheads are the worst. Dude managed to convince me to smoke crack while filming me because I was terrified to tell him no after hearing all the shit he had done. Fuck. That. Never went to that place ever again.

"TLDR: Are you depressed and stressed? Please don't relapse it'll throw away your hard work and make things worse most of the time. I hate to be the one that asks this, but you sound really depressed and while H may help, I'd do anything to avoid relapsing and seek medical attention for depression. Assuming you used to do crack as well for a while your dopamine receptors are probably fucked and will be for a while. You could try tyrosine which is a dopamine precursor in case your body isn't creating enough and Buproprion (Wellbutrin / Zyban) to help with that. It can even act as an adjunct medicine to typical SSRIs or atypical antidepressants as they act on different receptors. Alternatively psychedelics such as shrooms and disassociates specifically Ketamine are either being researched or actively available as new novel antidepressants (very expensive Spravato, Esketamine based nasal spray). They work quickly, promote neural development and with a bit of therapy can really help rewire the brain, unlike most antidepressant substances. Better yet, they are longer acting, with effects lasting a month / two months respectively. Of course if you are looking for none medicated options there's always rTMS which works far better than antidepressants in 60% if patients but requires daily sessions for a month. It has stimulates neural growth and connections iirc. it tends to help emotional blunting and motivation (dopamine) the most. Marry never require future treatment for depression, some require yearly or monthly top ups and some just need the occasional one off booster from time to time. If no meds or TMS work there's always ect (electroconvulsive therapy) which is much older and more serious but is mostly the same as TMS but with electricity rather than magnets. After that your nuclear option is vagus nerve stimulation which stimulates the vagus nerve at regular intervals and is apparently quite , effective (not sure percentage). But unless you can get the new external stimulation device it requires surgery and the effects can take six months to build up.

"I was in this predicament a few years when the pressies first came out, except I was ordering #H online and on day 5 of my detox, a little Dutch pokemon envelope arrived in the mail containing a gram of FIRE. Unfortunately, there were no pokmon cards included.  Anyway, all jokes aside, that really happened and instead of using the dope or immediately flushing it,  I jut sat on my bathroom floor looking at it for about thirty minutes that night after I couldn't sleep, again.  All I could think about was how this little powder had so much power over my life and how truly disgusting that fact was. Again, for me, I do my best work out of spite and determination. The next day after abstaining from using I called a friend that knew of my use (not a friend that used), to come over and flush the dope for me.

"No. Those rapid detox things are mostly a scam. If you take H for example, most of it will gone from your receptors in 24hrs, but WDs can last about a week.

Thats very different than feeling better. The one study I say that followed up stated patients went in, I think waited for close to 24 hours, did something like 12-18hrs under, then are monitored for 2-3 days, then are discharged and reported feeling remaining WD symptoms for 2-3 days after. So its still 4-6 days of shit, it just costs an extra $10k. ",2022-03-22T11:40:24+00:00,"H, opioids",homeostasis

Ha. I was on Heroin for three years straight. Didnt get in the least hit of trouble ever. Then got clean. Went through a six month inpatient program. Got out. Relapsed. Got arrested on my very first attempt to score. Got busted two more times in the following week and a half. That made me for the first time wanting to quit for 100% reals. The newly developed fear of getting busted again added just one more negative aspect to being in active addiction  but it was enough to finally tip the scale. Being in active addiction just got a little worse and is now bad enough that its not worth it anymore. ,2022-04-12T22:55:59+00:00,Heroin,

"We typically only hear about Ibogaine and it's ability to treat opioid use disorders but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Ibogaine has one of the most complex pharmacologies of any drug I ever studied. There is almost nothing that it does not do. You have the alpha 3 beta 4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor which is also the target of Wellbutrin that has this sort of smoking cessation anti-addictive effect. And then you have really high affinity relative to many of the other receptors at the NMDA receptor so it has a ketamine like effect. It hits the 5HT-2A receptor so it has a classical psychedelic effect. It's a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor. And it releases a protein called GDNF that regrows the dopamenergic neurons in the brain.

"In addition to writing up a taper schedule for yourself, it will help a lot if you also keep an accurate record of your taper. So each time you take a dose, record the amount you took and the date and time. If your daily dose has been 2 mg, you can start your taper by cutting by 0.25 mg and doing 10 days at 1.75 mg/dy.  Next, cut the dose by 0.25 mg again, and do 10 days at 1.50 mg/dy. Your taper schedule should be somewhat flexible. For example, at any point in your taper, if you don't feel well at a dose or if something extra stressful happens in your life, give yourself 2-5 extra days at the same dose before cutting the dose again. Avoid going back up to a higher dose however. Also, at any time in your taper, you can choose to divide your daily dose into 2 and do 1/2 the dose in the AM and 1/2 the dose in the PM. Sometimes this seems to help especially at smaller doses. So, after 10 days at 1.50 mg/dy, you can cut by 0.25 mg again and do 10 days at 1.25 mg/dy followed by 10 days at 1.0 mg/dy and 10 days at 0.75 mg/dy. If you're feeling OK, go on and do 10 days at 0.50 mg/day and 10 days at 0.25 mg/day. Even though this seems like a low dose, it is still too high to jump from for people like me who dread being sick so go ahead and do 10 days at 0.125 mg/day and then at least 3-5 days at 0.063 mg/dy. If you follow a schedule like this, you will not feel sicker when you go to zero. You should not experience restless leg syndrome but you may have diarrhea, extra fatigue at the end of the day and trouble sleeping.  I used Imodium as directed for diarrhea for about 5 days, melatonin for sleep and extra caffeine for energy to work during the day. I also made sure to go on a 2 hour walk with dogs every day. This is the basics. You can customize your taper to suit your circumstances. Please ask anytime if you're having trouble or have more questions. I wish you the best! Getting off feels really good once you do it. It is totally worth doing.

Not sure about the allergy pills but the Kratom will work. I wouldn't take it for any longer than 3 maybe 4 days tops. That stuff is a beast all on its own. I'd hate for you to get hooked on it. Does terrible things to the body long term. You got this!! Good luck. ,2022-04-19T02:51:15+00:00,Kratom,

Well I am glad to know I am not alone. Kratom W/D was pretty bad for me and non-linear. Like day 6 I may have felt better than day 10. I made it three weeks before I cracked. Currently on about 9-10 gpd and want to quit CT the next time I get a few days off work. ,2022-04-18T21:38:38+00:00,Kratom,
Taper the presses as much as possible. Switch to oral. Switching your ROI is a form of taper. You have 300 pills. You want to get down to 10mg once at 8 am and once at 8 pm. Figure out the math how you get there with a 300 supply. You will need to go through WD feelings as you taper. Its part of the process and a badge you get to wear when you are clean. Best of luck. If WD becomes difficult you could use Kratom but do so sparingly. It is not a silver bullet. ,2022-03-02T14:20:37+00:00,Kratom,

"doesn't work very well, you need a bunch of Kratom to get off H and not have withdrawals, which in turn will make you have Kratom withdrawals, even if you taper it down it's not nice you'll probably start with good extracts by 2x 5-10g a day, which you should try and take 1/4th off every 4th day, so day 1-> 2x10; day 4 -> 2x7.5; day 8 -> 2x~5; day 12 -> 2x~3g; next I'd try and come down from 2 daily doses to just one daily dose, and keeping the double daily dose just twice a week max, lowering the doses every 5th day down by half a gram until you're under a single dose of 1g, at which point you can either go off ""cold turkey"" and it will still feel unpleasant, or have a ""day off"" withdrawals twice a week or so. point being: it's basically easier, less time consuming and soul crushing to just get through the 72h of bullshit as fast as possible by abusing tranquilizers, than tapering. good luck out there, and lots of discipline! stay active, do sports, don't forget to eat, sometimes a paracetamol or an ibuprofen will save your day, keep your sanity, keep conversation with people, and don't watch too many horror-movies or MrBallen videos :D ",2022-02-23T15:58:37+00:00,"Kratom, H, Kratom, tranquilizers, paracetamol, ibuprofen",

I would get a 3.5 ounce bag of it and use it daily until it ran out. I never went over 2-4g when dosing.  Then I wouldnt buy any. I straight up didnt have withdrawal symptoms any of the times. I thought alcohol could be clouding those and making it easier to sleep. But nope, once I quit alcohol and didnt have Kratom - no WDs.

But using it for a few days to manage the pain and sickness of WD won't hurt you. I think part of it is also this obsession with suffering, as punishment for their addiction or proof of being ""clean"" to the fullest extent. It is sadly understandable, considering the stigma addicts face from every direction. Being one of the ""good junkies"" is a powerful and impossible standard, but one that the world demands.  Only you can decide what is right for you, but you can use anything you need to get past it. If you do try Kratom, try lower doses to begin, like 1 to 2 grams, and just see how you feel. You can try less than that, but if you've been on oxy you probably won't get too much help at a super low dose and you have to take therapeutic threshold into account.  I'd suggest doing it as a tea rather than anything else, because the plant matter can upset the stomach more for some people (I'm one of them), and you don't have to drink that if you lightly squeeze the bag after steeping to get the good stuff out.

"Definitely WD from Kratom. I was using about 25g a day of Ultra Red Maeng Da and Super Green Indo combined for about 5 years and it wasn't pretty. I started slow with Kratom and the dosage, but once it started to work right and got the dosage down, I started using everyday and then twice a day. It can be very difficult to stop and then it eventually started to make me weak and feel like shit, so I stopped. I needed some Subs to help with the WD because it was pretty brutal, but I only took enough Subs to stop the awful feeling of sleeplessness, RLS, cold sweats and nausea for 4 or 5 days and then I was in the clear. I stopped taking Subs by day 6 and have been good since. So only take Kratom as needed and in the appropriate doses to get what you want from it similar to Tylenol or something OTC to not get hooked. I suppose it depends on what you're taking it for. I have terrible knee pain from years of sports injuries, so I used it to replace my Oxy habit of 60-90 MG a day on opioids.

Kratom will help.. you been smoking it so def hitting you very strong compared to snorting and fet is so much stronger then blues . I would say try to go as long as you can fight all your cravings and shit and if u really not feeling good just dk a very small amount to feel bit better and taper that way. Tapering in the form of for example.. I got ten left I do 10 a day so if I do 5 then 3 then 1 then 1 then jump... you'll do all ten that first day. We can all be honest here. We all done it how many times. Self control is very hard as an addict so. Yes taper if h feem like u been using a lot or jf u can get peices of sub dk a small amount sk u don't send yourself into withdrawals but do small amounts multiple times a day if need and if u can just be in need for a week and you life allows for that then just buck up and do that. I said I'm done one weekend and after not being able tk really taper at all and h was bad needed a mat program tried tk be sick for 3 days and that did not work I had to go tk work I already missed kne day it just wasn't gon a work so the next day before qork I went to a methadone clinic and my life changed a 2 weeks after being in the program.

(Even if u took a bunch day one u would still feel off). Anyway after that first day which u wont feel too good, u should start to feel better and u must quickly taper the lope and just take 1 at a time maybe second take 3-4 (can take more but this worked for me). However within the first week u should try and get down to halfs, maybe two halfs a day by day 5, then half a pill for a few days then quit. For some reason the lope does a good job with the Kratom w/d. Obviously this could be a slippery slope as u definitely dont wanna replace the habit with lope, cuz that is the worst shit.

If it's not the Kratom, I would seriously wonder if you don't have something else going on medically. It could be a thyroid problem. I've working in healthcare for 10 years and am a current med school applicant. So I don't know everything but I do know this isn't normal.  I've been on suboxone for 5 years. If that's what you need to get sober then do it! No one looks at me differently. The pharmacy people are super nice. I've never been treated like an addict. People come into the hospital when they miss their doses of sub or methadone and even the hospital staff doesn't care. Not every doctor will know you're in suboxone. They don't know unless you tell them. So you can still manage future pain by seeing a different doctor. They can't refuse to manage your pain. You should express all these concerns with a doctor at a suboxone clinic. I am sure they can reassure you. Also look around. I go to a clinic once a month for my script. I don't have to do any ""rehab"".  I started out once a week, then every 2 weeks and so on. I hated the outpatient rehab I did they made you do all this therapy and classes.

If I were you I would do my best to get off all opiates.   Some things to consider: a sleep med would help a lot (trazodone is what I use), gabapentin, and clonidine. Weed is fine.

"Hey, sorry for the delayed response. I used Kratom to kick opiates about a year and a half ago. Unfortunately I didn't stop taking it and then got hooked on it. After 6 months my lymph nodes started to swell in my armpits and neck, then I would get really bad neck spasms that lasted all day long. A few months later my brain would feel like it was on fire.  Such a bizarre feeling that I've never had happen to me before and it was always about 40min after dosing. After about a year I ended up with a ton of digestive problems and found out I had IBS. A year and 5 months after taking it daily, my hair started falling out like a cancer patient. I'm not sure if it's permanent but I hope it will grow back. It was at that time that I found the reddit group r/quittingkratom. And there were dozens and dozens of posts where the same thing has happened to others from long term kratom use. Apparently most Kratom has toxic metals in it. Even if on their site it shows lab results for batches, they're mostly not true. Toxic metals reek havoc on the body and can cause symptoms like I mentioned and even worse, way worse. It was that and all the terrible symptoms that scared me into quitting. I am currently going through withdrawal (day 4) and it is exactly like opiate withdrawal but way longer (like suboxone) if you are currently taking kratom id suggest tapering yourself off and keeping yourself healthy.

"2-3 weeks ago she one day said she wanted to quit because she was having HORRIBLE thoughts of death. Not suicide but like dying and fearing it.  We were both doing around 15mg five times a day liquid somewhere I don't want to mention. Not as potent as smoking but stronger than orally. This went on for about 5 months. She started tapering faster than I did and at the end got down to 6mg twice a day (orally). I did a slower taper and got down to 9mg five times a day when our supply ran out.  I got on Kratom immediately so that she could WD first and then take care of me when it was my turn. I was using 4g of green 3-4 times a day and at night 4g at 9 pm and another dosage at 3 am.  Day one was rough for her. She broke down in the closet and I sat with her to comfort her. That night she took xanax, promethazine and something else to help sleep but had serious back pain which caused her to freak out. She took 2g of red kratom and passed out. She went through most of the WD without medication because she could deal with the feelings. Food was bland, think pho broth. Lots of liquids. She took two hot baths a day. Sleep was very broken. a few hours here and there. A week into the mental issues started. Depression etc. During that time the sun came out so we did some hiking. The sun really helps and the hiking helps keep your mind clear along with endorphins. Ample amounts of sex helped with dopamine. And since you go numb while on Fent, the sex was really great.  Then it was my turn and it was our hell for me. Not as bad as some of the accounts I read on here. Jesus, some of these stories will scare the utter living shit out of you. Be careful how much you take in because it can dissuade you and make you think it will never end.  The best advice I can tell you and what you should repeat on a daily basis when you are feeling down it this: For the last X months, you've been taking a drug that causes your CNS system to shut down. Your body sees the excess opioid as a sign that it doesn't need to create the necessary connections in your body, that's why it's great with fatigue and pain. When you stop taking opioids, your body isn't expecting this and takes some time to restart the process (Withdrawals). Everything you are feeling is your body remembering how to feel. Your brain is starting to create dopamine again but it's slow. Your mind/body will do everything in its power to convince you to take more drugs. Some people get really bad RLS and I've heard it's the body's last attempt to get you out of bed to find more drugs. Kicking the habit. Just remember every day that you are stronger than your body and that you want to feel normal again. So while it will try and convince you otherwise, remember that it's temporary and you will ultimately be stronger getting through this.  Some say going through opioid WD is a life-changing experience and I totally agree. It has changed me because I know I am strong enough to handle what life throws at me.

"Try amino acids. L-phenylalanine like 2gs every two hours, 5htp in the am and tryptophan at night. L-tyrosine is great to add in too. Start at a dose and gradually work your way up until you feel noticeable differences week by week. Then work your way back down. Cool thing about amino acids is that tolerance works in reverse. Less becomes more. Lions mane and other shrooms are great. I highly recommend microdosing psilocybin in post acute recovery. It has helped my overall outlook on life immensely.  I had a relatively severe habit on fentadope and 30 days off I still felt like ass. Better then in acute but depression, insomnia, sweats, anxiety etc. It wasnt until 90 days were I felt somewhat normal again. It takes time to heal man. Opiates fuck with how we regulate emotions a lot and it just takes time for that to heal but amino acids will help. Exercising is the other biggie for me and many others. Everyone should exercise but especially those in recovery. Its one of the fastest ways to reignite the system and feel good. It does take discipline to start and stay ontop of it but I promise you wont regret it. 10 push ups a day. Then 20. Then ride a bike or stationary. Im almost a year in and its a crucial part of my active recovery.  I get what youre saying about family and the perception of you. I felt that aswell and to a certain extent they werent wrong. I came clean to everyone that mattered and told them Im going to do the best I can but need their help in whatever way that is.

"Life is so good right now. Im 3 weeks clean. The turnaround from how I felt last week has been nothing short of amazing. I got through withdrawals but felt I was dragging myself through the days afterwards. I struggled with lack of energy & feelings of impending doom.  A poster here recommended L-tyrosine (& I read somewhere else to take it with vitamin B complex) so thats what Ive added to my supplements. It apparently helps with dopamine.  I was in such a funk & read a post on here stating how it can take upto a year to feel normal again. That bummed me out Im not gonna lie. I didnt see how I was gonna get through a whole year of lacklustre enthusiasm for life. Im thankful to say I dont feel like that any more. There will be days I feel low- I had that before I used so its to be expected. However I realise now its just that day, maybe two/ three but its not a forever feeling.  Im not saying it will benefit everybody but after so long abusing our bodies & mind, it couldnt hurt right? Ive found that rewarding myself with little treats each day is good too.

"If you can go to in-patient rehab, thats your best shot at beating this. With cash pay know that pricing is negotiable. Make sure they understand you can only do 4 weeks or 30 days, whatever youre looking to do. Most programs are 6 weeks or even more.  Rehab is a business, so know that you hold some power in how much you pay and how long youre there when paying with cash. Which can be a good and bad thing to be honest. When I originally went I filed FMLA and it was ran by insurance so although my therapist said it was a 30 day program, I ended up being stuck for 42 days. Had I left early I wouldnt have completed the program and my job would have terminated my employment. Specific in patient facility I went to in Jacksonville, FL charged insurance roughly $2k per day. Self pay for a month ranged from $20k-$30k.  The place was well kept and created an environment conducive to recovery. Know that there is going to be some dumb drama anywhere you may go, so associate yourself with those who have like minded goals, or career paths/ambitions. I was in there with NFL players, business owners, Fortune 500 execs, etc. Of course there was the average everyday blue collar worker type individuals as well, along with any demographic you can think of. The place I went to was called Lakeview Health in Jacksonville. Changed my life, Ive been clean over 9 months.  Make the change now before you lose everything you love, I seen it a lot when I was in there. Im lucky my wife didnt leave me and I didnt really lose much like others.

"Im on the lowest dose of Latuda (antipsychotic) Ive ever been on in the past 9 years and I feel utterly fantastic. After hearing the details of my psychotic break and the drug use that surrounded it, my new psychiatrist asked if I wanted to see how low I could go, to which I enthusiastically obliged. Im down to 30mg from 80mg over the past 5 months with 0 symptoms so far, and its just really hard to believe that Ive been on this stuff at that dose for what is practically my entire adult life. Im really starting to feel emotions and remember things that before just seemed to be like fog to me. Honestly, even if I could go no lower dosage wise, this has been a huge improvement for me as far as quality of life goes and Im so thankful I switched doctors.  What else? We got a second puppy on Tuesday and they are getting along great so far, although I gotta say its stressful trying to herd these two little guys. Duncan is 4.5 months old and little Leo is just about 3 months old.  I got my CPA and got a new job making 33% more base salary, with an 8% bonus, 5k sign on bonus, and 10-15% of base salary profit sharing. Im seriously intimidated yet excited to be stepping into a role like this. Would not be able to do this job sober. I start on 5/2 and Im just praying to God all goes well.  Almost 5 months completely sober. I was abusing pseudoephedrine for a little while last year. Its a far cry from heroin but it was seriously destroying my body and mind. My wife finding out was a blessing in disguise. I shared briefly about a month ago that we were having some troubles but I feel as though our relationship got stronger over the past month. I make more of an effort to spend time with her, with the med change my sex drive actually exists so were more active in that realm than we ever have been in the nearly 5 years weve known each other, and caring for the puppies has definitely brought us closer.  Im not sure what else to say other than I miss you guys. This sub was a huge cornerstone of my mental health for just about all of 2014-2017. Wouldnt have gotten off dope if it wasnt for it.

I immediately felt better and slept better than I had since starting the M30s. I can only attribute that to those M30s being so dirty and full on god knows what.

"Last night i hurt my wife's feelings badly, despite being aware that could be a possibility and trying specifically not to. That reminded me so vividly why i wish i didnt have to always be with myself. In retrospect, thats what i was looking for and found with drugs. Other people think im wonderful or something, i think they just see what they want to see. Im not trying to trick anyone. Or maybe these days if youre not like openly cruel to people, thats exemplary. Having a secret addiction really fit perfectly for me, since everyone thinks im a decent person, but i know better and my addiction proved it. So now im sober and i just cant escape from myself. Most of the time its fine, and im able to just accept everything i cant change. I think some of my problem is as follows. My wife has some physical/mental health problems, and it makes life difficult for her. It also affects me, in that i do very nearly all of the family tasks, and that we no longer have any intimacy in our relationship. So thats medication related, so there isnt anything i can do about it, and it isnt anyones fault. But it still wears on me, like any given day its fine, but over time, it sucks not to have that sort of relationship with my spouse. How can i address that though, it isnt her fault, there isnt anything that we can change about it. Anything i could say would be hurtful, and its not like she doesnt know. Methadone made her gain alot of weight too, so i understand that she doesnt feel sexy. I dont care, and ive tried to stay engaged by cuddling and hugs and stuff and reminders that i am attracted to her. Maybe 7 months ago i brought it up and she told me she doenst want to be touched, doesnt want to be looked at, doesnt want to be thought of sexually. So ive done my best at that, and i just feel lonely. Like sex is just one little thing we could do together, but it isnt like meaningless.  I guess im not doing as well as i thought accepting that which i cannot change. But then i recognize that me even thinking these things is incredibly selfish, my wife is the one who has to live with all of these difficulties in her day to day life. Its pretty unfair for me to be thinking about how her problems affect me.  So that brings me back to how much i feel like i just suck. Im apparently incapable of sharing how i feel without hurting her feelings, despite the intention not to. And then really, whats the point anyway. I might as well go outside and explain to the sky that im having a hard time with it raining so much. Thats just how it is. I guess i need to let go of expectations too. I understand sex is not a thing anymore, ok, but i guess ive been looking for some kind of closeness between us that just isnt available anymore. Shes not witholding it, she just doenst have it to share with me anymore. We're good partners and friends, and i guess i need to be thankful for that rather than wishing that we could be something that we no longer are. Edit: thanks all for letting me vent. Things are better today. I guess its progress that i slip into self loathing occasionally for a day or two tops, much improved from all day everyday. ",2022-02-23T16:24:29+00:00,Methadone,

I recommend a Suboxone taper (you start on subs and then they start to slowly decrease your dosage) to Vivitrol (injectable naltrexone, an opioid-alcohol blocker). The only issue with Vivitrol, is you HAVE to be opioid free for 5-7 days.  During those 5-7 days, meetings meetings meetings. Go to one every hour if you have too, theres a ton on Zoom. Go to NA, AA, SMART. Whoever and whatever you can.  MAT saved my life.

Methadone is what they use here in Boston to detox.  Drop from 40 to 5 in a week.    At the end if you still feel a tiny bit icky.  Take a benzo or a tiny 1 mg of sub after the last day.      This is how we did it in Boston.     We can't take subs to taper here anymore because of the fentanyl.   Pwd is Hell on Earth.  I thought wd was  hell on Earth until experienced pwd.

Naltrexone study helping get off Suboxone.,2022-03-24T12:52:20+00:00,"Naltrexone, Suboxone",
"Yes exactly how you said. I didnt believe it to. Everyday I was dosing my Naltrexone, I was expecting to go into Precipitated WDs. I was especially scared at 25 mg. But I did it anyways. And truthfully, for me none of the days were bad I would say really. I was in MUCH less pain doing this than I was getting on Suboxone from Fentanyl using the Bernese (microdosing) method.  But you must keep in mind, I was stable at a lower dose of Bupe than the Individuals in the study. In the study, they took heroin addicts off the street (also, the study states the volunteers were motivated), put them on Bupe, starting at a dose of 12 mg, then 8, then 4, then 2. They also went 0 mg naltrexone, 12.5, 12.5, 25, 50. I went 4 4 2 2 for bupe, and 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 for naltrexone. So my doses are adjusted compared to the study. With my doses, I didnt suffer much. Now this may have to do with my mental state at the time, luck, motivation, or a mix of all 3. For me day 3 was the worst, aka shitty sleep and tossing and turning.  In the study, day 2 was the worst for the group using Naltrexone and Bupe. After day 2, the WD only lessened from there. Day 5, all patients said they experienced 0 withdrawal symptoms.  My close friend was in Vivitrol as well. For a little under a year. He complained it made him feel off, lose weight as well, and ruined alcohol for him. But he said it was critical for him to stay clean and establish a normal, healthy lifestyle and curb cravings.

Its basically what occures. They use Naltrexone to rip the opiates off your receptors and put you under. Its quite expensive and comes with some risk from my understating. Being an addict though I dont think a little risk is much of a detourant  ,2022-04-10T23:54:38+00:00,"Naltrexone, opiates",
"TLDR; yes but don't do it. it's an unlikely risk tbf, but still there. Naltrexone is a long lasting opiate blocker. so unless you took opiates towards the tail end of your dose, it likely the opiate would have been metabolised before the nal wares off. Though yes in theory if you did realise you had taken a lot of opiate(/any amount and did not want to get high) and your nal dose was wearing off you could stack a dose. Though absolutely don't do this, it's 1 a waste of oppies and 2 very much a large gamble. If you nodded before taking the seccond naltrexone you would be a bit... dead.

"I was the same way. I wanted to be able to wake up and not have to take a pill or chemical to be myself or not sick.  Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist. Buprenorphine (suboxone) is an partial opioid agonist.  Suboxone activates the receptors alleviating withdrawal. Naltrexone attached to these receptors more tightly and deactivates them essentially and creates a blockade on all opioids receptors in your body, including outside your brain, like your gut. As for you question, truthfully I am not sure. I wondered the same. The way I see it is buprenorphine has a long half life and considering I have been taking it for several months, I would think you should take it for 10-14 days after stopping the suboxone because technically you do still have buprenorphine in your system. For example, people who start vivitrol (naltrexone extended release injection) after suboxone are usually instructed to wait 14 days minimum until starting vivitrol, some suggestions say one month even.  The beauty behind this method, according to the study, is the naltrexone displaces buprenorphine more gently and gradually than other opiates. The gradual increase in naltrexone dose doesnt send you into PWD I am assuming. But if you discontinue the naltrexone prior to all the bupe being out of your system, the buprenorphine will bind once the naltrexone is out of your system and then you essentially are back on buprenorphine.

Have you ever been narcand, especially if it wasnt necessary like some idiot friend thought it would be funny or for whatever reason youre a stupid curious idiot like I am and thought it would be an interesting experiment to see what happened if he took Narcan because he never had it before? If youve experienced Narcan and you know what I mean about the withdrawal from that how quickly it comes on and how acutely painful it is Precipitated withdrawals are worse at least with Narcan it has a very short half-life and peaks at like 45 minutes to an hour after an hour and starts to wear off by two hours youre starting to feel maybe human again by three hours youre looking for your dope ready to get fixed ,  assuming you werent already frantically looking for it trying to counteract the Narcan. By four hours its worn off and hopefully you had some opiates in your system before you took it because if you did then they probably are still there a little bit and youre not feeling completely dope sick but my point is Narcan withdrawal is like half as bad as precipitated withdrawal in my opinion. Precipitated withdrawal also last so much longer and its so much more intense. Dont take Suboxone if youre just feeling a little bit with Raleigh take it only when youre moderate to heavily in withdrawal Ive had to re-induct three times over the past year the first two times were a breeze. The first of the three I had waited over 18 hours after taking fentanyl and I was in pretty severe withdrawal. The second time I was coming out of the hospital from surgery and Im a very low-dose of hydromorphone contin  6 mg I took in the morning.. right at the 12 hour mark I was crawling out of my skin from being in withdrawal for the past four days before that but having that little bit of opiate in the morning I dont know if it made me better or worse because I had to wait 12 hours before I could take the Suboxone but I was like partially opiated but not nearly enough. Anyways right at 12 hours I caved and heres the other part that is so important especially if your high-dose user is even more important but hard. Dont take more than 4 mg the first day. On the second day dont take more than 8 mg. Has another user posted more than 12 mg is kind of excessive. 28 mg tablets is in my opinion unnecessary. Suboxone is such a long acting opiate that it takes a little while to ramp it up in your system like two or three days but I can go easily 48 hours without taking my Suboxone before Im starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. I used to be on methadone and I could barely get to it 24 hour mark and I will be scheeving for my dose. The half-life of buprenorphine is something like 72 hours or something I dont know its crazy long. My recommendation would be to the way I did the first two times. Start off with just 1 mg. Cut a 2 mg tablet in half and take that and see if you feel worse. Youre not gonna feel better from it but the keys dont feel worse. If you dont feel worse after half an hour take another 1 mg. Again if you dont feel worse after half an hour take the other 2 mg tablet. And then call it a day. Hopefully you dont feel worse after that if you do you just got a ride it out. Suboxone blocks opiates so if you get tempted to take them your normal dose before its not gonna be the same dose again. I if you ever get to that point that youre so uncomfortable in the induction process that youre thinking of using please PM me or somebody here who has had experience with ducting multiple times and has experience with taking full opiate to counter act precipitated withdrawal. Regular withdrawal aint shit compared to precipitated withdrawal. If you get a little bit of a regular withdrawal thats fine its not comfortable but its nothing like precipitated withdrawal. I have serious trauma from that shit its not even funny. I said I had been inducted three times in the past year but I only talked about the first two because they went smoothly I got on the Suboxone no problem but the third time I waited about 12 maybe 13 hours I was in mild withdrawal and I start off of 1 mg didnt feel worse 2 mg didnt feel worse popped another full 2 mg so thats four total didnt feel worse but then I kept going for some stupid reason. I took half of an 8 mg so thats a total of 8 mg right there and I shouldve stopped there because I started to feel a little bit worse at that point but stupidly I didnt and I took the other 4 mg so thats 12 mg but something told me spit this shit out right now and think I did because it was already bad enough as it was I was in such bad precipitated withdrawal it hit me so hard when I thought that I was in the clear. I know now that was because youre not supposed to take more than 4 mg in the first day. Ive heard of some people taking eight and maybe that works if youre in like severe withdrawal but if youre in just moderate withdrawal dont take more than four. There is this alternative way of inducting I read about on  PubMed what are you dont have to go into withdrawal first. Its basically Microdosing induction.  Its also called the Bernese method after the Doctor Who figured this out. Heres a link : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970598/ Basically its for patients who cant tolerate withdrawal and do a normal induction and they ramp you up slowly over a period of seven days. You start off on the first day taking 0.5 mg of Suboxone and thats it. Plus you take your regular opiates but no more than .5 Suboxone. Second day you do the same thing 0.5. Im not gonna give them any more advice on that I dont remember the exact details but read that article gives you sound scientific information. Ive noticed that a lot of these addiction doctors arent much better than the old OxyContin pill mills in the sense that they dont really care to help you out they care that youre gonna be coming back what often than a pain patient would be. They get you hooked on the axis you lose half your shit when it spirals out of control to heroin and fentanyl and then they really are back in for even more billable hours when you need to take Suboxone or methadone. Its a total scam but there are some good doctors out there. Im lucky I have one right now. I dont have to do drug tests and I do it all virtually the guy gives me a prescription for a month of them at a time I dont even have to do a witness dose anymore. Its great. It makes me wanna not abuse. I only had one little slip which is pretty miraculous. Good luck op feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

But frankly hardly anyone actually does that almost everyone uses something. But i agree on your definition of clean. Imo youre clean if you feel like you are. If youre on MAT and consider yourself clean i agree. As long as youre happy and loving your best life ultimately the labels dont matter i think. ,2022-04-09T20:27:15+00:00,"Nicotine, caffeine",
"I usually get very itchy as a sign of stress. The more anxious or stressed I am, the more intense the itching. Can be physical stress, perceived stress or emotional stress. The worst of it took about 2? 2.5? hours to pass in the end. I'm still itchy even now, but nowhere near as bad as earlier. Distraction helps to a point. Nicotine as well. I spent the entire itch session and a bit after doing puzzles on my phone around filling/clearing orders so my mind wasn't going ""it'll make it all better"" there were also a lot of cigarettes today. In fact, I'm about to go out for one, coz I really wanna pop a tab or 4 of the straight stuff. Probably just as bad for me in the long run, but for the short term, nicotine is an ally.

"I don't recommend to pick up smoking/vaping, but I agree with the other pieces of advice. Nicotine addiction is nasty and going without it leaves me incredibly antsy, easily frustrated. OP, if you can make it through physical withdrawals, get into sub treatment. If you can't make it through the withdrawals, methadone. Three months out of methadone treatment and I'm doing great. No cravings. Longer withdrawals, but with a proper taper, it is way more minor than going off CT. Also allows your brain to ramp up natural dopamine production which reduces the anhedonia we get which usually ends up increasing cravings, increasing the potential for relapse.

"Hey Buddy, good for you. You realize it's time to stop and you don't need to wait for rock bottom to come rushing up at you. I am in a similar boat as you. High-functional and money is not a problem, but I know I have to stop. For me, even more than the health concerns, it's really about personal freedom. I just don't like the idea of being fully dependent on anything, or anyone for that matter. I think about what might happen if I suddenly had to travel somewhere outside the country for a prolonged time and I was unable to stock up first. Or what if I end up in the hospital from a sudden car accident or a bad appendix? They're gonna give me 5 or 10mg of Norco every 4 hours and I'm going to be in withdrawal fast. There are numerous other scenarios that worry me. My addiction is just taking up too much mental real estate at this point and I don't have the time for it. Plus, my tolerance has reached the point where I hardly feel anything anymore when I use. Not for long anyway. It's more just withdrawal avoidance at this stage. Here's my advice to you. Until recently I was snorting about 180mg/day Roxy (true Rx, not fent) for 5+ years. Had a few short, failed attempts to quit over the years but never made it more than a few days. Last month I finally decided I was seriously ready to kick. Not facing any specific consequences, but like you I just want to be done. So starting 20 days ago I began a 5-day Bernese micro-induction method for Suboxone. (Day 1: two .5mg doses. Day 2: three .5 mg doses. Day 3: two 1mg doses. Day 4: two 2mg doses. Day 5: two 4mg doses.) Throughout these five days I was basically using 180/mg Roxy per day, cutting down just a bit on days 4 and 5. By Day 6 I did 8mg Suboxone and zero Roxy from that point forward. On Days 6 and 7 (when Roxy was fully discontinued) I had some minor stomach/appetite problems and some mild sleep challenges. Nothing major but I needed some Immodium AD for a couple days. I stayed at 8mg Suboxone a day until Day 10 and then cut it down to 6mg for the next two days and then I went to 4mg Suboxone a day up until now. So today is Day 20 since I started the Suboxone micro-induction process and Day 15 since I quit the Roxy altogether. I have felt absolutely fine from a physical standpoint for the last 12 days (no stomach, sleep, energy problems) but the mental side is the tough part still. I can't stop my mind from turning back to the idea of scoring some Roxy about 50 times a day. But every time this happens I quickly remind myself that the juice simply isn't worth the squeeze anymore, and there's a very good reason why I am doing what I am doing. I've also been forcing myself to get out of the house more and when I am at home I try to lose myself in good books, movies, podcasts, etc, in my spare time. Each day gets a little easier than the last it seems. No bullshit. As for recovery-related supplements, I take multivitamins and try to eat more and more healthy foods (including a banana every day or two for extra potassium, which is apparently important for those of us in opiate recovery). I also take 5-HTP (600mg/day) and DLPA (4,000mg/day) for better mood/energy/focus due to the increased serotonin levels. (Can't honestly say if this is doing anything for me yet but they say it takes 4+ weeks to build up in your system before it starts to work and there is a lot of evidence to suggest these two OTC supplements really are helpful in opiate recovery. You can find plenty of info about this online and you can buy these supplements from Amazon or wherever for under $20 each.) I also take Advil/Tylenol as needed (rarely) for muscle pain and I drink wine and smoke really high quality Indica to satiate my desire to get high and relax when that need arises, usually in the late afternoon or early evening almost every day. (I'm not worried about this shit at all right now. I'm pretty sure those habits will be trivial to break compared to my Roxy addiction.) I also have Xanax and Ambien, which I use at very low levels only to help with sleep, taken right at bedtime. (Xanax .25-.5mg a night or 2.5mg per night Ambien.) I don't need more than that and I dont need to use these every night. Most nights I am fine with just 10mg OTC Melatonin and/or 25mg OTC Diphenhydramine (common OTC Sleep pills). I only take the Xanax or Ambien when A) I absolutely need to go to bed early to get a good night sleep and be ready for work early the following morning or B) if I just want to sleep in the next day. These pills can leave me groggy in the morning and I don't want to develop any new dependencies so I use them sparingly, never more than 2 nights in a row or 3 times in a week. So now I have been on 4mg/day of Suboxone for the last 10 days and I am going to begin a taper down starting tomorrow. (Note: Some would say this is very aggressive approach and my chance of relapse is higher with such a short maintenance period, but I have no desire to stay on Suboxone - which can be just as hard to kick as H/Fent/Oxy - any longer than necessary. So starting tomorrow I will go to 3mg Suboxone a day for 3 days, then 2mg/day for the next 3 days, then 1mg/day for the next 3 days and finishing up with .5mg a day for the next 3-6 days, or until I can finally get to sleep without it. This is all unknown territory for me of course so I have no idea how this will turn out, but if I can stick to this plan I will have walked away from 5+ years of chronic daily opiate usage (and many more years of milder usage before that) after just one-month of Suboxone-assisted home detox. Then the hard part really begins: Not backsliding the next time something really good or really bad or really unusual or really boring or just a convenient fucking excuse to score happens in my life. When that time comes I just have to remember that I chose to go through all of this for a reason.) So anyway man, that was my ludicrously long-winded answer to your question. Like I said above, I have had my past experiences with failed attempts to kick opiates and this time feels like it might really work out so I just wanted to share all of this in hopes that you, and anyone else in our same boat, might find it informative or helpful. It sounds like you have a lot to live for and those levels of pressed fent you are taking every day really are dangerous. I think you know. So find a better way to spend your time and money and enjoy your life. Let the success of your business or whatever else matters to you become your new drug of choice, and get addicted to that. Whatever it is, it will be better than this, right? OK. Good luck, man. You can do this. I strongly suspect you have the will and the mental fortitude to overcome what many people cannot, but stay quietly strong and humble and don't ever underestimate the power of your addiction. (It's out there in the parking lot, doing push-ups right now, getting ready to kick your ass the first chance it gets, yada yada yada. Trite but true. Take that shit seriously, friend.) Happy to answer any questions you might have. Just let me know. Rooting for you! - T P.S. You'll notice that I did not mention AA/NA, group therapy, etc, in the above. I am the type of person who is very much inwardly-directed and I don't think those things will work for me (though I could be wrong about that) so I am trying to do this on my own for now. But obviously everyone is different and some people, perhaps yourself, might really benefit from this level of additional support right away. Please don't disregard this aspect of recovery if you think it might make sense to you. Probably worth checking out at some level anyway, which I have promised myself that I too will do the moment that the urge to relapse ever gets too big for me to contain.

"Hi there, good job for wanting to get off the pain meds! Opiate dependence and withdrawal is no joke and you were right to ask for advice. You're going to have to quit at some point anyways as opiate medication gradually ceases to be effective over time. I've been addicted to and quit opiates more times than I can count and I think I can walk you through the best course of action. I'm 6.5 months clean from opiates currently so it's not like I'm some junky offering you a ""blind leading the blind"" choice of scenarios. So, first: the good news. You aren't habituated to a very large dose. 15mg is not a large amount so your withdrawals will be minimal. However, given the duration of your use you will absolutely experience some discomfort. You're most likely in for a solid week of the classic opiate withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, anhedonia, depression, lethargy, diarrhea, restless legs, and so forth. After that you're looking at a month or so of gradually lessening symptoms. You may feel lingering effects for several months after. So, here's the deal. The only substances that will truly mitigate your withdrawal symptoms are also opiates. Many people during the withdrawal stage obsess over vitamins, diet, helper meds, exercise, and so forth. These are all well and good but in the end you're going to have to pay the piper. The only true cure for opiate withdrawal is time. Luckily you don't have a very heavy addiction, so that is good. You mentioned wanting to use kratom to ease the withdrawal symptoms. That is all well and good, however be aware that kratom is of itself an opiate and has a similar withdrawal profile. Many people switch to kratom to ease opiate withdrawal only to trade one addiction for another. Even if you do use kratom for a short period to ease the oxycodone withdrawal you'll still have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms when you quit kratom. I would just go cold turkey and ride it out in your situation but if you want to use kratom I would advise usage the same way they administer suboxone. Wait until you are in peak withdrawal. With oxycodone this will probably be around 24 hours after your last dose. The longer you wait the better. Then administer the lowest amount of kratom needed to alleviate most but not all of the symptoms. At 15mg a day of oxycodone I would say a gram or two of red variety kratom should take the edge off. Experiment for yourself. Document this dose (it helps to keep a journal) and then gradually reduce the dose over a set time period. Keep reducing the amount and time period between doses until you feel ready to jump off.  Good luck! If you have any further questions or need clarification let me know.

"Opiate addiction covers up physical and mental issues...Many people expect that they'll suddenly be the same as they were before drugs (or even the same level if they had mental illness beforehand) but once we stop the opiates we're left with fixing how much we've broken our bodies AND our minds due to just covering things up with a band-aid.  It took me literally years to undo the damage I did to my body while on opiates. I was finally diagnosed with PTSD, OCD, major depression, and a few other things and it suddenly made sense why I wasn't feeling better even a year after quitting opiates. My body was in pain because while high, I neglected my health...that took years to undo, but it got a little better every month I forced myself to take care of myself again (even though most days I could barely even get up to shower).  If we're not getting the right treatment, of course we're going to feel like shit tbh. Severe depression and depletion of feel good hormones in your brain can take a while to 'right' itself after quitting opiates, so you may need to be on an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication temporarily if you're not already. Depression and anxiety can cause anhedonia, which is a lack of pleasure in things...and we may need a bit of extra help getting through this.  I know not everyone has the resources to get help, but there are programs and other things available to low income or those struggling financially. You may also have a lot of success going to different groups around the area (many still do online meetings, others in person).  Recovery is just that...recovery. And it sucks ASS. It's similar to doing physical therapy for a broken bone or after brain surgery, learning to live again.

But the violence is not. There's something else going on here (likely some kind of untreated mental illness, but I think you know that). If he was just being lazy and obnoxious, that's one thing. But he's being violent in your home.  Stop and digest that for a moment. I know you didn't raise him to be violent. It wouldn't surprise me if he's pushed you or escalated physically. If he hasn't, it's almost certainly only a matter of time. Has your husband had to physically interfere when he gets violent? How bad is it, really?  I know it's your son. I know it happened slowly, and it has spiraled. But I don't think you realize how dire the situation is. Step outside yourself for a moment and imagine a good friend told you their son put hundreds of holes in their walls. You'd suspect he'd been violent with her too, and she just wasn't saying it. You'd be frightened for her. And that's how I felt reading this.  You've normalized his behavior so much that you're brushing off violence in your home. That's not ok. I'm not normally a fan of ever involving police unnecessarily, but if your safety is at risk, you need to call. That's how you'll get him out, like it or not. Because I know you're afraid of him. And I know you're afraid of what will happen if you ask him to leave. That is legitimate fear. ",2022-04-06T16:29:07+00:00,"Opiates, opiate",
"Opiates will stimulate your reward pathways. It's not real happiness. I have lots of opiate memories in which I know I was happy in the moment, but the memories have no emotional content. They taste like cardboard in retrospect. If you are a chronically unhappy person, start with an SSRI in conjunction with therapy. In almost all people, opiates will eventually desensitize those very reward pathways until you are unable to feel any rewarding emotion. ",2022-04-09T03:46:49+00:00,"Opiates, opiate, SSRI, opiates",

"There's definitely a lot going on here. A rheumatologist doesn't typically prescribe narcotic pain management, but seeing as this one sounds like he was older...well, it's not unheard of. But at the same time, you will likely have issues with other rheumatologists prescribing narcotic pain medication. It just isn't really their specialty, so if it's something they feel might be necessary long-term, they'll refer to a pain management specialist who is much more familiar with the available treatment options. As far as what you're in for... Opioid withdrawal isn't typically dangerous, it's just exceedingly uncomfortable. Assuming you've been taking this as-prescribed, you can expect symptoms to start being uncomfortable about 3-4 days after your last dose. Fentanyl patches have a very long mechanism of action and a very long half life, the drug sticks around in your fat cells so you won't go right into withdrawal after taking it. In the meantime, you should immediately call around to the local pain management specialists in your area. They can work with you to either get your prescription filled or safely taper you down from it and start another treatment. ",2022-03-09T21:33:37+00:00,"Opioid, Fentanyl patches",

But as a result, your body reacts by increasing the number of receptors to try to get the pain signal through again. Your tolerance to pain is lessened.

"My suggestion: if you cant withdraw fully from Oxy, go on Suboxone. Its still a narcotic but your not getting high. Then do a Suboxone taper, to get onto Vivitrol.  If you CAN taper yourself off the Oxy, thats awesome. You have to be 5-7 days opioid free, in order to get on Vivitrol though.  Its helped me immensely. I dont have cravings on it, at all. And I was someone who quit everything (opioids, Xanax, ketamine, alcohol) cold turkey. I was over 2 years sober when my cravings started getting really really bad again. To the point where I would curl up in a ball and be sobbing. To the point where if I saw my mom drinking a glass of wine, I wanted to tackle her to the ground to get to it. It was bad.  When I went on Vivitrol, all of that went away. My boyfriend was in active addiction and he could be drinking straight from the bottle of vodka, wouldnt even phase me. I could smell the alcohol on his breath as he kissed me and my cravings never made a peep. Thats how powerful Vivitrol was for me. It cleared the physical stuff away, so I could focus on the emotional reasons why I used.  (Btw, took my boyfriend to rehab last week and he will also be getting on Vivitrol when he gets out). Im actually currently ON Oxy, because I had double knee surgery 2 weeks ago, and I was forced to take it by my doctor, in order to heal. I was only given 5mg, that my mom dispensed to me. I have no idea where the pills are, she hides them from me. Im on day 2 of not taking it. Im hoping to get through my PT session on Wednesday without needing to take one. Then, I can get to April 26th where I have my next appointment to get my Vivitrol. If I do need to take an Oxy for pain, then I will discuss that with my providers and plan for the next week.

Best of luck to you! I ended up going the Sublocade injection route and it's been almost 3 months since my last shot. It feels great to not rely on something daily! ,2022-04-24T17:01:06+00:00,Sublocade,
After reading the prescribing information you unfortunately are not able to use Sublocade.  The lowest dose you can be on for this medication is 8mg. I hate withdrawal also.  The only downside with Sublocade is you don't know when the withdrawal is going to start.  My first two withdrawals were after about 16 days.  I only knew I was in withdrawal because I had the sweats.  That's all I had also.  But as soon as I got a 2mg strip under the tongue the sweats went away.  It did this two days in a row and then I didn't feel another withdrawal until about day 25.  Didn't have another one after that and my 2nd shot was given on day 28. ,2022-03-17T23:03:26+00:00,"Sublocade, Sublocade","sweats, sweats"
Have you thought about Sublocade? That's how I got off Suboxone. I haven't had a shot in a little over 40 days and I'm feeling amazing! ,2022-03-26T23:25:34+00:00,"Sublocade, Suboxone",
"Hi, yes I'm actually 100% clean now and used Sublocade for a couple months. I was just saying that Suboxone absolutely saved my life. I never would have made it this far without it. ",2022-04-05T21:39:38+00:00,"Sublocade, Suboxone",
Sublocade was amazing! I was stuck at 4mg of Suboxone for quite some time. My doctor had me go back up to 8mg for a couple weeks prior to my first 300mg Sublocade injection. It was such a smooth transition! I totally recommend. ,2022-04-23T01:55:06+00:00,"Sublocade, Suboxone, Sublocade",
Have you thought about the Sublocade shot? I had tried several time to come off Suboxone but was unable to do it. Sublocade has been a wonderful alternative for me. I had 3 injections total and now I'm done. No withdrawals yet but I've heard even if people have them they are minimal. ,2022-03-21T11:55:39+00:00,"Sublocade, Suboxone, Sublocade",
Glad you found something that works for you. I'm actually off everything now. I used Sublocade to get off Suboxone and it was a godsend! I don't ever want a narcotic in my body again. ,2022-04-18T16:58:06+00:00,"Sublocade, Suboxone, narcotic",
"Is the shot youre referring to Sublocade or Vivitrol? I know naltrexone isnt physically addictive, but buprenorphine definitely is... So, if you can skip a Sublocade injection without getting dopesick, thats wild news to me lmao ",2022-03-12T20:05:55+00:00,"Sublocade, Vivitrol, naltrexone, buprenorphine, Sublocade",dopesick
"Sublocade, sorry I should have clarified. Yeah its wild. I think you might need to get a certain amount of injections for it to build up in your system, but I could be wrong about that. It leaves your system so slowly that you dont notice. Trade off being that youll probably test positive for bupe on a urinalysis for likea year. At least I think I remember reading that.

"People do jump at fairly high doses, it's miserable though. I've jumped at 1-2 mg and it was pretty bad. I'm not afraid of Sublocade but the only reason I'm interested is because it supposedly smooths out withdrawal so much. If I'm going to stay on bupe I'd probably just keep using strips. But then there's the dental issues. I haven't considered using Sublocade long-term, just as a tapering tool. But it would be better for your teeth.

"You get the Sublocade shot monthly but still get high from herion? I didn't know that was possible. Also kind of a waste of a $2,000, or more, a month shot. I got 3 Sublocade shots and stopped. I'm doing great. If you're ready for sobriety Sublocade is definitely a good choice. ",2022-03-21T09:45:55+00:00,"Sublocade, herion, Sublocade, Sublocade",
"I'd love to try Sublocade.  I was just really, really unhealthy on kratom. Lost a ton of weight and had a psychotic break. So it was far from innocuous for me. ",2022-03-11T07:50:58+00:00,"Sublocade, kratom",
4mg is a fairly low dose. You aren't even close to the ceiling effect. I stayed on 16mg until I was stable then tapered and eventually used the Sublocade shot. I've never been to a methadone clinic however when I was a teenager we always used methadone to get high. ,2022-04-21T20:50:11+00:00,"Sublocade, methadone, methadone",
"I hope to get on Sublocade. If I'd gone an extra 10 days between shots and was feeling withdrawal, all things being equal I'd probably get another shot but that's just me. I'm not in a hurry and I want a smooth transition. If you want to get on naltrexone that's different. Are you in the UK? We don't have Buvidal in the US as far as I know. The choices are 300 and 100 mg, designed to be released over 30 days though it actually takes much longer for it to completely leave your system. ",2022-03-14T03:29:06+00:00,"Sublocade, naltrexone",
I actually am on Sublocade 100mg and then strips as needed. I don't plan on coming off suboxone for a few years. I have already been on it for 2 years now. I had a brief 1.5 month relapse after 1.5years clean...juat trying to get back to where I was sadly. ,2022-04-16T13:06:45+00:00,"Sublocade, suboxone",

"Totally agree, when I mentioned the thing about you holding them I did take into consideration you guys have only been together a few months, so I know its probably awkward and weird to even take on that responsibility. But regardless even if he took more than he does now he would still be in recovery and he would still be working his program and taking with a doctor is prescribing him, and you definitely can go in there and say you know Im trying to be sober Ive been taking Suboxone on the street this is how much Im taking I dont really wanna take anymore because Ive been feeling really good at that dose and they wont put you more than that if you dont feel you need more than that. Yes they do try to put you on higher amounts in the beginning but if you know what you like and what dose works for you they shouldnt do that.  Also its good you know early so you can watch for signs of any adnormal behavior in the future IF that ever happened. and support him thru his journey  Good luck hope everything works out ",2022-03-29T12:11:33+00:00,Suboxone,
Your own pillow. I was withdrawing from Suboxone and sleeping on this stupid plastic pillow that made crunching noises. It was fine during my taper but once off everything I hated the feel and sound of it. So ... bring your own pillow. I think theirs were disposable. ,2022-04-14T08:12:38+00:00,Suboxone,

It's not easy but it's still 100% worth it. I was on Suboxone for almost 5 years and don't regret it one bit. ,2022-03-20T23:56:18+00:00,Suboxone,
"I recognise what you wrote a lot, I was in that phase for a long time. To be honest, I couldn't do it then. I could do it later, but not then yet. I was able to quit later, with help, but not in that phase yet  I would be able to stop for a few days. I'd be sick and take a few days off from work to get through it and recover. But I'd never hold out longer than a few weeks until I caved in again. It took some incidents at work and while driving to get me to look for help. Eventually I got clean by being prescribed Suboxone, which I'm slowly tapering off now (after 10 months on it). So what I can say to you, from my own experience, is even if you keep on failing to quit now, it doesn't mean you are destined to keep on failing. Eventually, you will succeed. And sometimes there's pain involved, like getting arrested or banging into someone in traffic while nodding off. Or a close friend or family member cutting off contact with you when they find out. This pain serves a purpose; it can make you hate the drugs so much that you can use it as relapse prevention. ",2022-04-24T06:51:09+00:00,Suboxone,
"Same! The 3 weeks I was on Suboxone and actually took it seriously (not like the 4 months prior), I gained deep gratitude and appreciation for the medication. It's good stuff. But to me, I wanted the ""invisible chains"" off as soon as possible. ",2022-03-11T18:36:35+00:00,Suboxone,

"Thats a tricky question because there are more variables than just that. Suboxone allows a taper down because the urge to abuse it is not there. This makes it entirely possible to taper, and if you do it properly, yes, there will be minimal symptoms. My best way of putting it into perspective is that you could taper yourself into complete sobriety without missing a single second of work. Sure you might not be 100% for some of the days, but youll be 90%. Much easier to deal with than actual WD. ",2022-03-11T16:37:00+00:00,Suboxone,

I had issues with my muscles that prevented me from starting sooner (sore back and legs). The mental game for me is getting above a threshold to start a positive feedback loop.

Absolutely! There's no way to find a reason I also haven't been able to find a reason for my own problems. Sometimes things just are the way they are. Could be genetics could be a ton of factors all into one. All I know is he won't get any better staying with you guys and it does nothing but hurt you guys and him to keep him there. There are support group meetings for families of addicts called AL anon. You can learn a lot from them I'm sure. I don't think that 12 step programs work for everyone though. I think medication assisted therapy or MAT shows to be more successful but he won't stop until he's ready and until then keeping him at the house is just prolonging the madness. Alcoholism is very similar... addiction is addiction. Substance doesn't matter much the behavior is the same.  I guarantee that beautiful person is still there in your son. Not all hope is lost. I will say as I've been on Suboxone for 9 months and tapering off of it now I am having a big identity crisis but also I'm getting in touch with things I used to enjoy before I climbed into this mess. Drawing reading music golfing. It's still there... the monster kind of suppresses a person and if he ever gets off the floodgates will open the emotions everything you've had suppressed bubbles over it's very intense. So be ready for that too if he does get clean he may seem even more unstable than he was in active addiction. I wish you the best. Thank you for loving him through it but it's time for tough love. Edit. I'd like to add excuse are plentiful. Sure life has been tough the last couple years for him but those types of things become crutches. I am queeeeeen of excuses. If anybody every needs an excuse for something I can figure out about 100 excuses in about one second. Also queen of minimizing everything. I can make something horrible look understandable and not that bad in a heart beat. It's disgusting but I've learned how to do that how to manipulate every situation from addiction.

Haven't you ever seen intervention? Lol this sounds like classic enabling. It's one thing being an addict. I am 26 I can't imagine acting like that toward my parents even in the worst of addiction. Disrespectful little prick. Take him to rehab or kick him out. It's not going to get better if it continues like that. He won't get a job? I'm sorry fuck that if I acted like that with my parents I wouldn't even be mad if they kicked me out. What does he expect. Good luck. I'm sorry I know it would be really hard to do that to your own child. I have a child but she is only 5 so I can't totally relate but I am a parent and least. But I'm also an adult addict and I have parents who also have been together for 30 years and raised me in a stable loving middle class home. So I actually really can relate. I hate that you're family is going through so much. I have very much so put my parents through the wringer in different ways that how your son has. And it breaks my heart that they blame themselves. I sure hope you don't blame yourselves but you need to kick him out. You're not going to be able to change his outlook. I have no other advice. My parents took my daughter from me and that's what it took for me. The next day I went to the doctor to set up an appointment for Suboxone induction and got stable on it within that week. And I am so grateful they did that. I wouldn't be sober today if they hadn't done that. It's embarrassing sure but it's real life in addiction. It's a wild life I can see why you'd think he has brain damage. In a way he does. It's a dopamine disorder. Especially if he started as a teen. Again please don't blame yourself.

Idk who god is I don't subscribe to any religion but I believe in God. I think God is infathomable therefore any holy book could never do him justice.  Also mothering my addict sub personality and having to say no and send it to timeout has helped me if I look at it that way and tell it. No you can't have drugs but you can have music or a book which would you prefer and it stomps it's feet and throws a tantrum and eventually receives the book or the music or the sunshine whatever it is. ,2022-04-19T00:25:30+00:00,Suboxone,fatigue
Thanks for your reply. Im glad everyone was so supportive to you during your  pregnancy. I go to a specialist clinic that deals with MAT pregnancies and they have been amazing there with no judgment. The only time I really have  noticed it is when I have to go to the maternity ward. Its even worse because I work at the same hospital in a different unit and really dont want anyone knowing what I used to be like before I worked there. Ill try and take it in stride and remember its an accomplishment and anyone I know thats gotten sober I am so happy for so Ill try and leave it in my past. My maternity Doctor said its very unlikely that my baby will have Any effects from Suboxone after being born. So I just have to trust that baby will be ok and not torture my self about it. ,2022-03-24T16:35:37+00:00,Suboxone,
You know I great underestimated the value of therapy along side the medication. I tried Suboxone multiple times without medication and it was basically just to keep me from getting sick. Once I started taking it along side therapy AND was willing to listen and take advice with an open mind. Only then was I able to get clean. ,2022-04-07T19:43:53+00:00,Suboxone,
why use Suboxone if the withdrawal is the same?,2022-03-11T01:30:36+00:00,Suboxone,
You shouldn't need any of that other stuff. If you need something at night to help you sleep then any of those meds could help. If you feel you need something at other times for individual symptoms just take normal dosages. Ideally though the Suboxone transition should be fairly seamless but it does depend somewhat on what you're coming off of. ,2022-04-22T05:18:44+00:00,Suboxone,

"Really good insight into what you have going on! Recovery has been so good for me too, and ive been learning to be more self aware like that, too. Suboxone has been great for me too. Ive been on it like 14 months steady. Im starting to taper (8mg to start and currently at 6), but everything is going fine, so i have no reason to rush. Like it would be nice to someday not have to take it, but taking it is fine too, so there isnt any pressure for me. I know its early and it gets harder as dosages get lower, but im sure itll be fine, whatever happens.  Using wasn't nearly as nice as how my clean days are now.  One time i relapsed and i was talking to my counselor about it. I was saying that it had been kind of a let down, like i was craving so hard and anticipating that it would be so great, but it wasnt everything i hoped for. She kind of shrugged and said ""yeah using isnt much fun with a head full of recovery"". That stuck with me. ",2022-03-17T12:59:47+00:00,Suboxone,craving

"I was using daily for 15 years and kept relapsing until I finally gave in and went to outpatient and talk to a therapist about my underlying issues and see a psychiatrist to get on medication. After being in Suboxone for a year I was told to focus on my mental health issues because I wasnt in danger of relapsing. At 30 years old I was diagnosed w ADHD, c-ptsd, severe anxiety and depression and until I got help I only had opiates to get relief so I kept going back. I had been self medicating to avoid feelings or even thinking about my trauma. If I did stop I would get triggered and there was only one solution. The opiates helped but soon I could only get fent and that was not helping me the same anymore. I was using opiates and functioning at work and used them to get motivation and focus and fentanyl did not do the same thing for me at all. I knew fentanyl wasnt what I wanted but I was still thinking about the good parts and would forget the bad. After a while everyone wanted fentanyl and thats all I could find.  I am 2 years clean now and I just started a new ssri that seems to actually be helping so far. When I first got off opiates I tried an ssri but I didnt even give it a chance because I didnt want to be taking something every day for the rest of my life (unless it was my drug of choice). At this point Im willing to try anything to help me, now that I know I actually have mental health issues and its not just in my head. I probably should of been on ADHD meds before high school but I was against medication because of my parents. I was trying to treat my addiction but my addiction was a symptom of my underlying mental issues, I was self medicating to get relief, until I started to get help for those issues I felt like I would always go back to opiates.

How long did you stop Suboxone before going back on Suboxone and did u have to relapse first? ,2022-03-21T13:04:47+00:00,"Suboxone, Suboxone",
"Thanks. Even if you are the only one who took the time to read it and found it helpful then it was worth the time it took to write. Here is a summary of key points to remember as you get ready to kick:  Suboxone. Period. It's the best and most important tool in your toolbox, period. I wouldn't stand a chance without it. The traditional Suboxone intake method (i.e. wait 12-24+ hours until you are experiencing real withdrawal before starting with your first 4mg dose, followed by another 4mg dose a few hours later) is a nightmare for two reasons: 1) You have to suffer for hours and hours before you can start and 2) Fent stays in your system much longer and therefore provides a higher chance of precipitated WD, which is horrific and must be avoided. Therefore the Bernese Micro-Induction Method for Suboxone (which I described above) is DEFINITELY the way to go. Aside from Suboxone, stock up your personal ""quit kit"" with Advil or Tylenol, Melatonin, OTC sleep medication, Imodium AD (loperamide), Xanax and/or Ambien, 5-HTP, DLPA and whatever else you need. Then stock up your kitchen with bananas, V8 juice, water, wine/beer/liquor (if that's your thing and won't trigger relapse) and lots of easy to make comfort food. Whatever foods you like best, with some prepared meals for the first two days. And don't forget the weed if that's your thing. Find ways to keep yourself occupied and entertained, whatever that means for you. Movies, books, video games, social media, etc. Get out of the house after the first few days and try to get some good exercise, which will help you sleep and rebuild your brain's natural capacity for endorphin production. Learn about recovery from the experience of others, whether that's through books, movies, podcasts or by attending NA meetings or the like. Getting past the physical transition from oxy onto Suboxone is really not that hard (when done right, it's just 1-3 days of mild physical discomfort and poor sleep). By the end of Day 3 you should feel fine. The hard part is the mental side going forward. Your addict brain will seek every opportunity to break down and score. If this happens, don't get off the Suboxone and go on a bender. Keep talking your daily maintenance level of Suboxone (4mg is good for most people) ```and just go ahead and bang few oxys for a day, then set them aside and continue your recovery plan the next day. To be safe, wait at least 12+ hours after your last Oxy dosage before taking your next dose of Suboxone the following day. You won't get as high as usual from the Oxy but you will still feel it, and the chances of you having precipitated withdrawals is slim to none because of all the Suboxone already built up in your system. Just don't take any more Oxy the next day. A one day slip is manageable. Don't let it turn into a full relapse. Lastly, try to get off the subs within 30-45 days if possible. Quitting Suboxone after prolonged usage will be just as hard as kicking Oxy.  GOOD LUCK, BUDDY! YOU'VE GOT THIS! STAY STRONG AND WORK YOUR PLAN!

If done right, when you finally stop using Oxy you will barely feel a thing because the Suboxone will have taken over all the opiate receptors in your brain by that point. Virtually zero withdrawal. Aside from Suboxone, stock up your personal ""quit kit"" with Advil or Tylenol, Melatonin, OTC sleep medication, Imodium AD (loperamide), Xanax and/or Ambien, 5-HTP, DLPA and whatever else you need. Then stock up your kitchen with bananas, V8 juice, water, wine/beer/liquor (if that's your thing and won't trigger relapse) and lots of easy to make comfort food. Whatever foods you like best, with some prepared meals for the first two days. And don't forget the weed if that's your thing. Find ways to keep yourself occupied and entertained, whatever that means for you. Movies, books, video games, social media, etc. Be prepared to get out of the house after the first few days and try to get some light exercise, which will help you sleep better and begin to rebuild your brain's natural chemistry/capacity for endorphin production. Learn about recovery from the experience of others, whether that's through books, movies, podcasts or by attending NA meetings, online support groups or the like. Getting past the physical transition from oxy onto Suboxone is really not that hard (when done right, it's just 1-3 days of mild physical discomfort and poor sleep). By the end of Day 3 you should feel fine. The physical part we all fear really can be almost fully managed. IMO, the hard part is the mental side going forward. Your addict brain will seek every opportunity to break down and convince you to go out and score after you have a week or two under your belt. If this happens, and you can't stop yourself, just don't get off the Suboxone and don't go on a prolonged bender. Keep talking your daily maintenance level of Suboxone (4mg is good for most people) ```and just go ahead and bang few oxys for a day if you must, then set them aside and continue your recovery plan the next day. (To be safe, wait at least 12+ hours after your last Oxy dosage before taking your next dose of Suboxone the following day.) You won't get as high as usual from the Oxy but you will still feel it, and the chances of you having precipitated withdrawals is slim to none because of all the Suboxone already built up in your system. Just don't take any more Oxy the next day. A one day slip is manageable. Don't let it turn into a full relapse. If that happens, start up again at step 1. Relapse is part of recovery. Lastly, try to get off the subs within 30-45 days if possible. Quitting Suboxone after prolonged usage will be just as hard as kicking Oxy.  PLEASE NOTE: I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. THIS IS JUST BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. BE SAFE AND CONSULT A PHYSICIAN TO DISCUSS YOUR RECOVERY PLAN. GOOD LUCK AND BE SAFE!

To my knowledge Suboxone is available in Canada. Try lookng up Suboxone doctors in your area. As far as Kratom I would personally stay away from it unless you think you can take it for a week or 2 and stop.

"Call and find out what detox programs they have. Some hospitals have outpatient where they give you a script for Suboxone and send you on your way. Some hospitals have inpatient detox where you stay there for 5-6 days and they may offer Suboxone taper or maintenance, or Methadone taper/maintenance.  If you were doing fent then youd have to wait a while before taking Suboxone, otherwise you can get violently ill. What I did during intake  is ask them to put me on a Methadone taper, after which they put me on Suboxone maintenance. This way the short Methadone taper acted like a bridge between fenta-dope and Suboxone because even if I waited 72 hours before taking Suboxone I would still get precipitated withdrawal.  They put me on the Methadone taper with 30mg on day 1 and every day they would drop the dose by 5mg. Its not a big dose but with the Methadone and comfort meds it was surprisingly alright. Once I told myself that I will see this through and wont run out of the hospital I didnt have that anxiety anymore that would usually make withdrawal seem a lot worse if I was at home.  I was eating and sleeping every day which was a miracle. And on the morning of day 6 I took my last 5mg dose of Methadone. In the evening of the following day I took my first dose of Suboxone and it finally worked like its supposed to. So if you can get inpatient detox it would be a lot better than doing it by yourself at home where your chances of giving up and relapsing are much higher than if you were staying in detox.

I think Suboxone is the better choice for MAT if you have transportation issues. If you do the work on why you started using and address things like your mental health during use it won't start you back where you started. I was on Suboxone for 12 years and switched to the Sublocade injection and had absolutely no WD coming off of it. I had tried many times to taper but never could by myself. The injection  does it for you. I got 2 300mg injections that last for 1.5 months and 2 100mg injections that slowly dissolve. It's been out of my system for 2 months now and I feel better than I have in a decade! If the choice is MAT or dying of an OD I would choose MAT especially now that Sublocade is out to make getting off much easier. You'll still deal with the mental side of it like not being able to do a little more when you're stressed but get through the first month and it's a game changer! ,2022-04-16T12:57:20+00:00,"Suboxone, Suboxone, Sublocade, Sublocade",
Okay that's good advice. I used for 10 years as well I wanted to stay on Suboxone for a year. But I just really don't want my baby to have to withdrawal if possible. I want to try at the very least and try hard! I do feel a little irresponsible. I won't lie. But these things happen and I'm trying to do what I feel is the right thing. That's not to say people who choose to stay on are in the wrong I totally understand why someone would. But I'm just so ready. I've never felt so determined and I'm doing a lot to help myself this time as well. If I feel like cravings are too intense at any point I plan to get back on the Suboxone and hope for the best. But it's about a 50/50 chance the baby is dependant and that is not fair. The baby didn't ask to be made.

And it takes so long to get out of your system that you can only take so much of the withdrawal then youll go running back to the Suboxone just to put a stop to it and then it starts all over again and again and again and again it took me at least 30 Tries before I actually pulled off a negative Suboxone drug test it absolutely does not have its own tapering system mechanism ,2022-02-24T20:15:33+00:00,"Suboxone, Suboxone, Suboxone",

"Congrats man! Sounds like you have the mental strength to stay with it. One quick thing to keep in mind about the Suboxone. It stays in your system for like 2-3 days, so when you stop taking it you probably won't feel anything the first or even second day, but you may feel it after that. If you do, I assume you have more Suboxone? If so, I would just take the minimal amount to make the WDs tolerable. (Maybe 2 mg?) Then you could see how it goes from there. Maybe do an every other day taper down to a half mg on your final day. That might smooth it out. I am on plan towards that same kind of taper off Subs in the near future too.

"No it's not. This is what it says in the Suboxone medication guide: ""For Suboxone to make you feel comfortable quickly, you should take your first dose when you start to experience the first stages of withdrawals. The more you are in withdrawal before your first dose, the more likely you are to feel better quickly. The time you should wait after your last drug use varies from person to person but it is typically: At least six hours after last heroin use Or at least 24 hours after you last took methadone"" Not sure who is in withdrawals after 24 hours with no methadone, but the important part is that the more you are in withdrawals when you take it, the better it will make you feel.  Assuming op is doing the same presses we have in the PNW, then you will be in severe withdrawal after 24 hours being off blues, and taking Suboxone can't put you into previptated withdrawal unless you are on opioids to begin with. Otherwise there's nothing to precipitate. You are already fully in withdrawal and there are no mu agonists left in your blood for the Suboxone to block, so it can only make you feel better. You have no clue what you are talking about and you are subjecting people to unnecessary pain for no reason. Fent has a shorter half life than black, therefore you need to wait less time after stopping fent than after stopping black. Anyone who makes a claim to the contrary is either remembering their induction as way worse than it was, isn't being honest about how long they had been off before taking the subs, or has severe liver disease to the point where they don't metabolize drugs anymore (my money is on the first two).

You should be fine to start with a low dose, start with only .5mg and wait two hours and if you don't feel worse than take another .5mg. Tread lightly today and do not over do it.  Yes, .5mg isn't much at all but if for some reason you took it too early than you would know to not take anymore.  My advice would be to settle with 1mg to 1.5mg for the first day and that's honestly pushing it.  Suboxone binds to those receptors hard and the last thing you want is to feel worse. If day 1 is a success than day 2 will be your day of relief. 1mg of Suboxone is equivalent to 30mg of morphine. ",2022-04-15T16:03:53+00:00,"Suboxone, Suboxone, morphine",
I tried anything and everything too. Suboxone did it for me but only because i was entirely completely surrendered and I was finished. Just done with all of it. It took me 10 years to get there. I don't have any answers for you but when you're ready you will be ready. I'm a fairly firm believer in that. It's something we can't control we can't fight. I mean that is very generalized. And recovery is not cookie cutter and I honestly don't know fucking anything. I'm not trying to discourage you. I am an idiot. So take what I say with a grain of salt. But that is my experience and I guess that's all I can say it took near death experiences over and over and over and over again waking up on the floor half dead hours later with a needle still in my damn arm. Just absolute filthy disgusting human behavior. I was on Suboxone for 6 months and I'm tapering off now. So dude I'm not even completely sober lol but I'm confident in myself this time. It's the only time I've quit that I knew it was over. For good. There's just a switch that flipped in my brain. I wish I could give you a big hug. The lifestyle is so hard. So hard.

"People often don't taper off Suboxone properly. If done correctly it can be fairly painless. I recently posted about my thoughts and tips about Suboxone for maintenance. It gets a bad rap and is often cited at being more difficult to get off than the original opiate. I believe there are a lot of misconceptions about getting off of Suboxone. If you are going to use Suboxone for maintenance, I recommend the following:  Taper down to 4mg as soon as possible and stay on 4 for the duration of maintenance. Doctors will often push a higher dose than necessary and push for longer than necessary. A high dose is fine at first but anything over 16 mg is too much. Don't jump at anything less than 0.5 mg and ideally jump at 0.125 mg (or less). Finish the taper by dosing every second day. Taper slowly. Ideally cut your dose by 25% every week. E.g. 8mg to 6 mg to 4.5 mg to 3.8 mg. Its best to use the strips to achieve accurate dosing or a scale if you only have tablets. Suboxone calculators are easy to find. If you are tapering and in withdrawal, take a small amount until you don't feel withdrawal.  I think these horror stories come from the fact that doctors prescribe way too high of a dose and push people to take it for longer because it's profitable. Also, since 2mg is the lowest dose, people jump at. Taking subs is a godsend for me. I was able to get back to life and not have mental health issues (which I've struggled with). Suboxone isn't mentally addicting. You aren't tempted to take more than your dose and lowering your dose is quite easy. When your life is going smoothly, tapering is easy. One dose a day means no highs and lows. I haven't fully tapered off Suboxone except going from fent to Suboxone to sober over a few weeks (and that wasn't fun) and I relapsed right away. I've read many accounts of people's Suboxone taper being painless. And I think paws can be minimized with a slow taper. You are in very the worst. Just try and hang on it will get better every day.

"I've only ever successfully tapered on Suboxone.  Likely due to the fact it provides minimal kick to an addict.  With everything else I fuck it up and convince myself ""I'll get high today then suffer extra tomorrow"" and swap the doses around or some other addict shit.  Suboxone just keeps you well, it makes it much easier to only take what you need to stay well as any more and you don't get high unlike almost all other opiates.  I'd argue it's almost pointless to attempt a taper aside from a crash course taper on dirty 30's because.. you don't know exactly what or how much your taking.  You'd have to crush each pill into a fine uniform powder or make a liquid solution to dose and even then you don't know how much OR what you are taking.  One dirty might have 0.25mg of Fent and the next might have 0.5mg. You just can't accurately taper on that sadly.  Good luck dude, it's a rough spot. Try Suboxone if you can.

Where do you live? In Canada it wouldn't be a question. I know some states are harsh on addicts. I absolutely think you qualify for Suboxone. Any reasonable doctor will give you a maintenance subscription for Suboxone. Even an unreasonable doctor should give you enough to do a three week slow taper. The only thing I would be concerned about is a doctor who is pushing too much subs on you.

"I actually agree with 99% of what you said lol. We think almost exactly the same about Suboxone.  We only differ in a few areas, 1:  Subs were mentally addicting for me lol. I was constantly redosing, taking too much and having to buy more. My Dr. Had to up my dose and even put my on the subloccade shot so I couldn't take extra. That was just me though, it's not everyone  2: Nothing actually. I can't find anything else I don't agree with from my experience with it.

I don't believe people should rush into Suboxone, but once you're on it, I'm a firm believer in also not rushing off of it either. The best taper I've experienced was when I chose my own doses and just took my sweet ass time. I'd take 6 mg for a day, 8 the next, 6 mg for 2 more days etc. and if I felt too sick I just took a tiny bit more as you recommended.

Eventually, the tolerance Id built up made the cost outweigh any benefit, & so I stopped using it as frequently. I decided it was time to get back on Suboxone after my girlfriend informed me that shes pregnant & is keeping the baby  despite the fact that wed previously made a serious agreement to terminate an unplanned pregnancy, well before it actually happened. Thats the gist of it, anyway. ",2022-03-21T22:35:55+00:00,"Suboxone, bupe, kratom, Suboxone",cravings

"Ive Posten this several times and suggested it to many people though it's still very unknown and it really needs to be. You don't need to taper off bupernorphine. It's essentially got built in tapering ability with what's called the ""ceiling effect"" where the more you take the longer it stays in your body. This goes against what most people understand which is why it's so unknown still. So if you needed say 5mg to stabilise at your base dependency level, if you take 10mg than it will keep you stabilised for twice as long as it's normal half life's .. It's not as perfectly calculated like that but it's pretty close... To the point if you take a large (10x) your stable base amount then it will take such a long time to detox from you that you essentially naturally ""taper"".    There are probably a dozen well documented studies online proving this method  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-018-3055-z&ved=2ahUKEwiz_a_o0Jf2AhUSG7kGHUCQB-gQFnoECCAQAQ&sqi=2&usg=AOvVaw2rzt-ZoJ9m7xKb5gGvDkSf https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02791072.2001.10400484&ved=2ahUKEwiz_a_o0Jf2AhUSG7kGHUCQB-gQFnoECAwQAQ&sqi=2&usg=AOvVaw1ZBHhYUp_krL_LeYehjOSz It's often called ""rapid detox"" and if you look on medical journals and other places studies are published you'll find plenty of proof. So much so that I used this method myself.  Taking about 5x8mg (40mg) Suboxone at once after over 36 hours since my last use of heroin. And I can say now it was absolutely incredible . It was so effective the next day I was in Bora Bora swimming with dolphins and then went diving  Then hiking the day after that... Enjoyed 10 whole days before I got diahriahh and insomnia for a few nights but that's all I got...  No other withdrawal symptoms at all and yeah they took 7-10 days before I felt anything..

"That's weird. In my experience they'll raise the dose a lot faster. That was at private clinics, I don't know if that makes a difference.

"Part 2. Comment too long.  I know. But hey, they're strong enough to White knuckle it in the rest are pussies so it's unlikely they want to understand. Ultimately it really just reflects on them though. Anyone who is Matt adamant about medication not being recovery clearly feels some type of way that if they can do it then everyone can and if not then they must try to get here recovery solely for people that take no medication. It makes me even sicker when I mention that my beauty is for pain management purposes and high somehow rece ive even worse responses very often for that. I guess having health conditions calling for meds is somehow even worse than needing meds to stay alive and sober. I honestly find more flaws in whatever recovery program encourages this type of stigma tour of attics man programs that include meds. Because at the end of the day I work my recovery in many ways and if needing Suboxone to be able to like walk and experience my recovery is so problematic I truly pity people that make room and their recovery just to knock others down.  .  I think a lot of people are completely misinformed and uneducated on the topic of MAT. I know before joining the methadone clinic, I was one of them. I avoided methadone like the plague because of all the negative shit everyone had to say about it. Which, come to find out, majority of it turned out to be complete bs anyways.  This exact thing deters many from getting the proper help that they personally need, which never the boy leads to relapses and deaths.  I struggle to see how people that discourage maintenance users from even trying as recovery. Because how can you be in recovery while also shining others and indirectly ending up making someone else give up on recovery?   I thought I was trading one addiction for another. I didn't realize the major difference between addiction and dependency. I thought I was going to be a ""slave to the clinic"" like everyone said. Little did I know, I'd be only going once a month to pickup my takehomes after a while. Just like I was going to the pharmacy to pick up any other monthly script.  Exactly. Too many people on Recovery aewm to believe they have shit to do with another patient, the recovery, and any meds they may or may not take.   I've noticed to that a lot of addicts in active addiction, don't want to stop getting high. And they use the excuse of not wanting to be on subs or methadone, because they say it's ""basically the same as doing dope."" When it's not. They just don't want to quit, so they use that as an excuse.  Pot calls kettle. But wait I forgot, we are the ones who make excuses even though we do quit, we just don't do it there away. It's really nice that not only do we have a lot of ignorant real police, but we also have ignorant recovery police as well!   I think a lot of the misinformed people preach like they know what they're talking about. Then others hear that, and believe whatever they're saying. Then they spread it to someone else and it goes on and on and on. I wish people would just do their own research or give MAT a chance themselves.

"Hi, I got clean with Suboxone. It helps a lot. Getting on it may be difficult because it displaces full agonist opiates that are already pleasant. However I think it's totally worth it. I got on it at home. I'm in Europe and don't know how it is in your country, but my addiction treatment doctor phoned me every so many hours to see if I was OK on the first day of taking it and I had his private phone number to call if something went really wrong in the weekend. For me it has helped a lot. I agreed to be on it because it would help with the withdrawals and then I wanted to taper off it slowly after a month or so. However I'm on it for 9 months already. My mind changed on this. It has some minor side effects (see below) but the benefits really outweigh the cons. Also in the long term. Benefits  If I decide to take heroin or something else it won't work, I would really need to plan a relapse 36h ahead of time; stop taking the subs, wait, ... That alone is a huge deterrent and helps not to use. It reduces cravings for opiates and I believe for other drugs as well. It acts as a mood stabiliser / takes the edge off of life a little bit. Buprenorphine doesn't get you intoxicated if you're opiate tolerant but it does provide a small opiate effect that make me feel stronger and less susceptible to life's hard feelings.  Cons:  Constipation. For this no full tolerance will develop. My doctor prescribed me a supplement for this, a powder that I get from the pharmacy and drink it every day. Note: The constipation wasn't so bad that it needed treatment in its own right but it made me nauseous and feeling full the whole time, we reckon this is because the food was passing slower from my stomach onwards. Benefit #3 is also a downside; it slightly numbs my emotions. It makes me more assertive and optimistic, I feel it's almost similar as to what an SSRI antidepressant would do, maybe a bit less or different. This also means I feel the warmth of social interaction less. I like being around people but when someone says something nice to me I like it and I thank them and smile, but I just don't get that warm feeling that I used to. I can't say for 100% that it's due to the bupe, or from the addiction or just me getting bitter as I get older lol but I read that others have this too and become somewhat less social.  Now compare these cons to a life of active opiate addiction... Good luck with your decision. Also please keep in mind that although it's somewhat of a commitment to get on it and to go through the process, you can always change. Nothing is forever. You could try it for a month like I did. It's easier to get off a light opiate with a long half life, than a full agonist with a short half life.

If you can go down on fent while increasing subs in theory you could be completely transitioned to Suboxone in 7 days. Then either continue taking Suboxone or make a plan to get off it. I can't guarantee minimal withdrawals, that's asking a lot but this has worked for some people. You don't necessarily need to get up to 12 mg, you might get by with less. What you shouldn't do is wait 24 hours then use 8 mg Suboxone, there's a high potential for precipitated withdrawal.

"I only had it once in December. I didn't get a bruise, but I'm a fat fuck. For constipation, your best bet is PEG (Polyethylene Glycol) and eating healthy. I am in Canada where strips aren't available. In terms of other side effects, I didn't have much. If you are sleeping too much, that is the opposite of withdrawal. Maybe your dose it too high. That would also explain the constipation. Suboxone has a ceiling effect in terms of making you feel opiated. If your a smaller guy then 300mg might be a lot. 500 mg of oxy is a lot. But I was using like 500 mg of fent a day (Street fent - which is fent and caffeine, meant to simulate heroin). For depression, exercise is your best bet. You could consider a low dose of Wellbutrin if you are comfortable with antidepressants. I have heard that doctors in US over prescribe subs and won't hear anything different. Make sure to insist you don't need 300 next time. Also I went 40-45 days before I started introducing oral Suboxone. I started with 1mg and after 42 days or something and worked up to 8 mg when I was comfortable the shot was gone. The bead didn't fully dissolve for 60 days or so. Part of the reason they give you a lower dose is because there is still some left. If they didn't use a new spot for the second shit that could be why you bruised.

Many people don't have much trouble getting from 16 mg to 4 mg or lower.

Subs will definitely help by day 4.  I took 8mg of sub maybe 15 or so hours coming of pressed 30s and was fine. I was on subs for 4 months or so before relapsing and ended up on fent/dope powder since it was cheaper and attempted to induce subs around the same time and went into serious precipitated wd. I think it depends on the analogs. Start with super small amounts not the whole strip. The cows scale should give you a good indicator to the severity of your wd symptoms and when it would be ok to start. You could also try the Bernese method.  Glad your here man. This community is truly special. We are all in this together. I try to stay active on here since it helped me so much when I was getting clean. Coming up on a year pretty soon!  Good luck!

This is how I view it...if you were a loved one asking me for advice. My life experience. No judgement. Just the truth as I see it: Subs...made me a bitch to subs. And still hell on Earth to get off of. In many ways it was worse for me. But I can see why people say it's lifesaving but they aren't really taking into account quality of life which is big. My thing is we all have to come to the table regardless unless you plan on being on subs for life...which is not really a life. People talk about this sublocade shot and swear by it. I've always seen it as suspect because how can you get better if you didn't learn your lesson. There's life and then there is dignity. If your brain says I will get the sublocade shot you will see no consequences at the end of the day and your first instinct after that will be to go back to that well because in your mind you absolutely can. And that's cool but what is the price of that behavior. You can never really know is my point.

"I made this post years ago when a father came to reddit to ask about his son's addiction. It helped him understand what his son was dealing with, so maybe it will help you as well. The first step is understanding why addiction is so powerful, why we say we want to stop yet cannot hold true to that promise a lot of the time. Her reaching out is a very good first step. Following up on that is where many of us fail. I would have killed to have people around me to assist in the next steps which is why I actively help others any way I can. We would all be better off with people around us to help. She must make the decision to stop on her own. There was not a single rock bottom event that made me stop. Nothing anyone would have said would have made me quit before I came to that decision on my own. Even then, I would relapse over and over, quickly getting back to the same spot I was in before. Open, judgement free dialogue is important. There is a lot of shame in addiction. It's a big thing that keeps us from admitting to ourselves that we cannot stop on our own and need outside help. Therapy is another thing I would recommend. Depending on how long she has been using, her habit, the strength of her withdrawals, how many times she has tried to get sober- maintenance medication is an option. Vivitrol, methadone, suboxone. It is heavily dependent on her situation so she would need to speak to her doctor and then visit a treatment clinic to learn more. NA is another option that some people swear by. Look up local NA chapters. Help find psychologists under her insurance. Find local group therapy as a free option. Locate maintenance programs in the area, call and ask about how intake works, pricing, insurance. She has to be the one to follow through. Help set doctors appointments so she can get professional help and advice. Lowering barriers of effort would have helped me a lot. I had to do all of it on my own and I  kept me from getting on methadone. If I knew what I do now, I would have gotten into treatment years ago. Happily sober off methadone now. Best of luck to her. You're a good sibling. Please make sure she doesn't take advantage of you though. Addicts do a lot of things we end up regretting later out of desperation.

Boredom usually gets me thinking about it. Get into a hobby you can do at home. Even doing 20 push-ups gets me distracted long enough for the thought to pass. Im coming up on a year clean CT and still think about it from time to time. I have relapsed in the past and its never as good as you remember. Usually il puke and feel like shit for having spent the time and money to get that poison.  Weed also helps me not want to go back but its not a great solution.  Best thing is to separate yourself from the voice saying you want that. See it like an alter ego out for itself thats basically trying to make you go back. Fight it with everything you got. The craving will diminish over time.  Congrats on making it this far! Those first few weeks arent for the feint of heart haha. ,2022-03-21T22:04:24+00:00,Weed,"Boredom, puke, craving"

It is mild, not an SSRI, not addictive, easy to get off of and super easy to get prescribed through Telehealth (K Health, Done, etc.) right over your phone and pick up the script the same day. I was feeling how you are at around 140 days and got a script for Wellbutrin and it definitely helped, I ran it for only about 3-4 months and then just stopped taking it and still felt good. There is no shame in taking something like this for a short term to help you get past the hump. Just an idea you can consider. PS: Also RUN! Running helped me so much, got to the point I was up to 5 miles a day before it got cold out. PSS: Try a Ketogenic diet, I feel like that helped me as well. When your body is running on Ketones rather than glucose (carbs) you kind of get this electric energy feeling. Also you will lose a lot of fat if that is something that you care about.

My mind never stops racing and I obsess and overplan every aspect of my life, which can take away joy from the moment because Im planning and thinking of whats happening next instead of living in the positivity/happiness that could already be surrounding me.  I told my psychiatrist an example. My example was that when I looked for my last new car, I would research on Autotrader for like 3-4 hours a day, for weeks on in. It got to the point that I could be a few hundred yards away from any car and I could tell you the make or model and be within a couple year range of the vehicle by simply seeing the front or the back. Again, thats just one example but Ive been like that with everything. Sometimes I think its because I needed to when I was younger, to survive and make it out the circumstances I was given in life. Either way, now I know its ridiculous and absolutely exhausting. My psychiatrist started me on Zoloft and it really changed things for me. I had a moment where something pissed me off and I started over thinking how things could play out like I did before with 4-5 different scenarios, then all of a sudden my brain said fuck it, life is good. Im so much happier on this SSRI, and Im someone who never thought I needed something like this.  Talk to a doc and get an SSRI that works for you!! ",2022-04-08T03:55:10+00:00,"Zoloft, SSRI, SSRI",

"Yes, you'll experience withdrawal from that dose. If you've been taking a combination product you are also getting quite a lot of acetaminophen (paracetamol). Both can make you nauseated as can withdrawal itself. I'd say you'll be feeling better in a few days but not 100 percent for at least 2 weeks. The second week will be better than the first. I would think universities would be fairly sympathetic. Don't know about your parents, do you generally have a good relationship with them? As far as how to tell them - I don't know. ""Mom, Dad, I've really been struggling"" might be a good way to start. I don't remember codeine withdrawal that well but if I understand correctly you are actually withdrawing from morphine due to the way the body metabolizes codeine.

"Going to rehab is what got my girlfriend her adderall prescription back. Also Ive seen plenty of people use emergency medical leave to goto rehab. Hell I did it myself. So that covers both bases.  Your choice though.. you can keep on suffering and using and shit, or you can put in some work and detox, go through an inpatient and learn some coping mechanisms/tools and go from there. Also not all doctors are out there to take away your script because you use heroin. The psychiatrist at the MAT clinic I go to prescribes vyvanse and adderall. Theres a chance you might lose the script.. but if you do some research and ask questions about the place before going there and you find a place that seems to actually have your best interests in mind after you finish researching it and asking your questions youll be able to get these answers. I strongly recommend either MAT or inpatient if you are having troubles quitting on your own.. you listed many possible ways to start your recovery in your post. Personally Im thankful I have the opportunity to goto rehab, or take suboxone/methadone to help me get off opiates. If you have a full time job, use your insurance and goto rehab. Its called FMLA The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides certain employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year. It also requires that their group health benefits be maintained during the leave. FMLA is designed to help employees balance their work and family responsibilities by allowing them to take reasonable unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. It also seeks to accommodate the legitimate interests of employers and promote equal employment opportunity for men and women. FMLA applies to all public agencies, all public and private elementary and secondary schools, and companies with 50 or more employees. These employers must provide an eligible employee with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year for any of the following reasons: For the birth and care of the newborn child of an employee; For placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care; To care for an immediate family member (i.e., spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or To take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. It literally says FMLA is allowed for taking medical leave when an employee is unable to work because of a serious medical condition.

"Youre prolly going to lose that adderall rx anyway if youre using opiates. My wife was in a very similar position, and her provider looked the other way for years. Eventually someone new came into their office, and was understandably not willing to prescribe amphetamine to someone who is also clearly addicted to opiates.  Also, id point out that if youre needing to be using opiates everyday, then your adderall probably isnt very effective in treating whatever it should be. If it was effective for you right now, you wouldnt have used opiates to feel ok, leading to addiction. Long story short, dont not get help because youre afraid of losing your rx. For my wife at least, alot of the things that she needed the adderall for were made much worse by her opiate addiction. In recovery, shes been working on fixing the underlying issues and thats helped. She still has the problem that she was prescribed the adderall for, but it isnt any worse now then when she was on the adderall. Overall, shes come out way ahead by not having an opiate addiction anymore, despite not having the adderall either.  Get some help. Its scary. Really scary.

What happened was I got sick of all the negative consequences that came with my use. I believe some people can use casually and not become hooked. However that isnt me and I know to steer clear of it entirely, or Ill wind up back down the same path. Most likely death because there is rarely any heroin out there today that isnt cut with fentanyl. Idk I hope that helps ",2022-03-03T20:03:57+00:00,"alcohol, heroin, heroin, fentanyl",

"Oh man, my drug and alcohol abuse history is a long and complicated one.  Started at 15 with weed and alcohol but my reaction to alcohol scared me.  At 17, I got Oxy for my wisdom teeth.  At 18, I started college and my drinking started to get out of control. I had my first blackout within 2 weeks of starting college and kept it going from there. I tore my ACL/meniscus in October 2013.  In December, I had my surgery and I started combining alcohol with painkillers.  By the time I was 19, I was drinking every day and taking a maximum of 900 mg of Oxy. I was also doing ketamine.  I would continue that pattern, eventually switching to snorting. Eventually I realized I was gonna start doing heroin soon. So I quit cold turkey. It felt like the flu but I counteracted it with drinking more. So I dont really remember a lot about that time period, because I was always blacked out.  I got kicked out of college, started working full time. Weaned myself off the pills and stopped drinking every day but I had weekly binges.  At 20-21, I started smoking weed every day and combining that with alcohol. At 21, I got my first Xanax.  At 22-23 I was in a very abusive relationship, with a man who was giving me meth without my knowledge. He was spiking my other drugs. (I only discovered this in recovery btw, because someone said to me you dont get auditory and visual hallucinations from ketamine or dabs). I also became very addicted to Xanax.  May 7th 2019 was the last time I had an alcoholic drink. October 31st 2019 was the last time I abused an opioid pill. June 11 2020 was the last time I had a Xanax. I quit everything cold turkey.

Though, and this is just my take, I think by day 4 you pretty much always are on the downhill, its just that when people say day 4 was awful or the worst, its less that the wd were actually the worst and more that youve been suffering for 4 days, no food or sleep, it takes its toll.

You taper up until you hit bowel tolerance... meaning you get the shits. If you find true liposomal C you will likely avoid all bowel issues.

This process is also very possible with regular ascorbic acid but it's tougher on your tummy. This is where immodium come in! Take 2 to 4 at a time. You will be fine. A very important part of this process is to start taking high doses 2 to 3 days before full WD. So it's already in your system. The antioxidant stops the chemical that makes you WD from forming in your brain. I was taking 3000 mg every two hours then over the course of a week I worked my way up to 5000 mg every two hours.

"First of all, my heart goes out to you. And I want to scream ""hang in there, it will get better!"". Your situation is similar to mine, with some differences. When my kids were little, I was going to nursing school. And I worked part time. So I had 3 young kids, went to nursing school full time and had a part time job. And I did everything at home. Even the dishes when I got home from my night job. I started getting daily migraines and was put on barbiturates. I got addicted. Then I was taken off of them and put in oxys when a doctor gave me shots in the neck to help with the headaches but he messed up somehow and the problems I had in the neck all of a sudden started hurting a lot and all the time. Over the years doses went up but I cut down drastically, little by little. Then I hurt my back at work and had back surgery. Dose went up again and down again, and now I'm at 45 mg a day, and I'm stuck there but my doctor wants me to keep reducing. During this whole time, my husband was abusive as well, emotionally and verbally, and didn't help me at home whatsoever. He was not an alcoholic, so that's where our stories are different, and he has changed. You see, I ended up on disability for depression with all this. I had to quit nursing school because of my back. In the midst of all this I went to psychotherapy and stopped being a victim. When I stopped being a victim, he stopped being the aggressor. It turns out he loved me enough to change, but I don't know if that is the case with your husband. He really should help you. If he doesn't, he doesn't love you. You see mine has no regard for people who are addicted. He despises them, so I hid my addiction from him for years. Also every time I thought of leaving him he said he would take the kids. One was his, one was mine, but we had a daughter together. And he used to say he would take her from me, and because u went to a mental hospital one time because I was so depressed, I was afraid he would take her from me. I'm sorry to say this but it sounds like you need to take your kids and go. I am finally back at school because I have to be able to take care of myself financially. So I decided to do medical billing and coding. I wanted to go back to nursing school but my doctor didn't think it was a good idea because of my back. After I graduate I will be able to take care of myself and when I do I will decide whether I want to stay in this marriage or not. Because all these years have caused so much resentment. You say you had surgeries, are you able to do the physical aspect of nursing? Maybe you need to take care of your home life first, and once you're out of there with your kids and you have created a more stable environment for yourself and your kids you can work on quitting slowly. You don't automatically have to go to rehab. Yes it's quicker, but maybe it's not an option for you right now. Unless someone from your family comes and stays with your kids. But it sounds like you need to stop looking for your husband's help and help yourself. You see your kids are little, but they are growing up in this environment, and they see things. My husband has changed but my kids grew up watching us, watching this unhealthy marriage and watching him treat me like shit. Today I blame myself for it. I was trying to give my daughter a stable home, and out of our 3 kids she has the most problems. I blame us. I blame myself for staying. You don't want that.

"I'm so glad to hear a neuroscientist say it's not all or nothing. Addiction treatment is being hamstrung by these ""all or nothing"" people & treatment centers. Yes, some may need or choose to fully abstain but to others this type of thinking will lead to the addict giving up with treatment all together. Especially true in the younger addicts who either refuse or can't wrap their heads around ""never again"".  Absence also alienates addicts, especially alcoholics, when something a normal person (or even a person who hasn't admitted to the problem) does is completely ok but if someone in recovery does the same thing it's horrible and a failure. For example having a single beer with dinner. The whole idea that we can't retrain our brains is absurd to me. It's exactly what those who have multi years of sobriety and claim to no longer have cravings. ",2022-03-13T22:53:38+00:00,beer,cravings

"Ya bro it really is like an unstoppable cascade. Its like, I can think about getting a beer, and maybe stop, maybe. But once I take just a single action towards getting it, even just standing up from the couch with the intention, its over Im going to the store. Im getting that beer and Im drinking it, the end. Same with dope. Once I start the process at all its basically auto pilot. But Ive noticed that there are for me 2 points of no return, as in not just hard but impossible if I go this far. The first is calling the plug. Unless they are out or something its gg at that point. But the real point of no return is starting the drive towards the spot, at that point there is no way on earth Im turning around. Ive tried to stop at that point many times and its like Im not even in control anymore. Maybe all the times it was such a struggle to get the money/set it up etc. once money is in hand, its set up, and Im on the way, there is no way Im not smoking some shit in about 30 minutes. So the trick is not letting it get to those 2 key points for me. Do not call the plug, for damn sure dont start the car, because theres no stopping it then. But really, the best thing is to stop it in its tracks, when the thought pops onto your head, because as I said once I start taking any actual action, its like auto pilot. I really dont even feel in control or that I can do anything about it.

I guess thats one of the tough things about this- what helps one person with certain symptoms may have a different effect on another person with the same symptoms. clonidine has always helped me at least feel a bit calmer and less restless during withdrawal. ive also taken seroquel for sleep which has helped a little.

"If you're on a short acting benzo like Xanax try to switch to something you can take once a day like diazepam. If you're not prescribed a doctor might be willing to help. The speed, weed and coffee will suck but none will make you that bad physically.

Then you can work out what the hell you're going to do about the benzos.. that's going to suck. Hopefully you're not on much more than 1 or 2x the therapeutic dose, in which case you can taper over a month or two. Regardless, even a couple of bars or Xanax a day could lead to seizures stopping CT. If you're going to just jump make sure someone's about to make sure you don't hit your head on something.

Weirdly for me sleep - while being disturbed - is nowhere near as bad a symptom for me as it seems  to be for others. I read stories about other people in WD getting like 1hr a night.  I took benzos in WD and I got maybe 4 hours a night. Last night might have been 6? I count my blessings for that - I hate not sleeping. No benzos tonight.

"Yeah likewise. I'd taken a break from Reddit as a whole but really it's been like with IOP and therapy 10hrs a week talking and hearing about using... Especially doing it so far into recovery lol you know? Everyone else in my IOP group is in very early recovery. It's an awesome perspective to have being a few years in tho but I've got to say lately I've just been way over thinking about fucking drugs. That's good to hear that is small and monitored, I was on a very small benzos script for a while too. I'm not currently prescribed, seeing as best of possibility again but until then I really very take any benzos unless my BPD has me in a while episode or something and I can't calm down. MMJ helps me a lot though so I really don't even need the Xanax as much honestly. Which is good, after kicking my Suboxone and my benzos cold turkey last summer in jail I would almost rather suffer with my nerves rattle to holy hell then risk being dependent on benzos ever again.  That's great to hear! Probably the best success story as far as coming off of methadone I've ever heard honestly haha. That's good.  And I'm really well, all things considered! Got some legal stuff still sorting through, but it's not that bad. Have been doing IOP for a while now and it's helped a lot. Stable just on low dose Suboxone and gabapentin for the pain, and mmj.

"Yeah, this is great advice. Short acting benzos are notorious for causing horrific addictions and seizures. Let me ask, OP, what, how long, and how much were you taking (in terms if benzos)? Because that has a lot to do with the withdrawal and the proper way to manage it. There is a painless method for getting off benzos but it requires a year or two depending on your level. You just do a very slow taper. As far as suboxone, Im coming off of it myself right now. Its actually been extremely mild and I was very surprised but I tapered well. I also wasnt on it for more than a few months this time. Again, the length if time spent on it will affect the length if the taper and whatnot. If youve been on it for years then you are likely saturated with it and you may want to go more slowly. Or you can go balls to the wall and just rough it out. Again, idk how much or how long youve been on bupe. Last time i got off of it I tapered and did a week at the methadone clinic at a really low dose. Seemed to make the bupe leech out of my system while also lowering my tolerance and not getting me habituated to the methadone. The kick was definitely shorter. You could also opt for getting a naltrexone prescription once you get off of opioids. Ive used it for years and it really does seem to help one recover faster. Although Bupe outcompetes naltrexone (I learned this by rapid detoxing myself one time with naltrexone and couldnt handle it and took some suboxone and felt right as rain.) but once youve been off the subs for a bit and the receptors arent saturated the naltrexone should help speed up their recovery. Look into low dose naltrexone. You wont suffer any physical withdrawals from the other substances. Headaches from the lack of coffee. You may feel a lack of energy coming off of adderall but that will also happen coming off subs or any opioid. As far as the order of doing all of this, well, Id cut caffeine and adderall out first. Those are the easiest. I mean, weed is easy, too, but I find it useful when withdrawing off of opioids due to nausea and GI discomfort. Then I would come off the suboxone. I would probably taper the entire time I was cutting the other things. Its actually a pretty forgiving drug in terms of quickly lowering your dosage. Once you jump off you will likely still want to have Benzos to ease anxiety and help you sleep. Just try to keep it to a minimum if you can. There are other meds that are very useful for opioid withdrawal, such as clonidine or tizanidine. Other comfort meds for GI upset that help are zofran for nausea and be tal for cramping. Other things that help are heating pads or hot water bottles, fans, warm baths, magnesium, gas X, and some good old fashioned movement. And stay hydrated. Find some sustenance you can keep down. Ive been drinking lactose free milk and eating saltines. As far as the benzos, discuss that with a professional. If its very serious and you are having physical withdrawals seek professional help. Thats a lot more of a difficult issue.mare you spasming in the morning or having seizures?

"Glad you want to get clean! It's so much better on the other side. So a few things about your post.. first, every clinic is different. But my clinic would never turn you away for having benzos in your system. They just wouldn't give you takehomes until thats outta there. Other places give you a little time to get off the benzos and if you don't, then they can discharge you from the program. So it really depends on the place itself. The next thing I'm wondering is, you want to taper starting at 20-40mgs? No methadone clinic will do that. What they do is start you at a lower dose (usually 30-40mgs), then go up until you get to whatever your stable dose is. Then you'd stay on there for a little while until you decided to taper. Typically the quickest you could do the program without jumping off at a high dose, is 6 months to a year. But my starting dose the very first day was 40mgs. If youre doing fent and a lot of it like you said, 20-40 isn't even gonna touch you anyways. I needed over 100mgs just to not be sick for the full 24hrs. It sounds like what you need is a detox facility instead of methadone clinic. The detox I always went to, they used methadone and would do a five day taper with 40mgs the first day. Then 30, 20, 10, 5, then nothing. That sounds more like your plan. But whatever you decide to do, good for you for wanting to get off the fent. It's just not worth messing with it anymore.

A common mistake is to start with a low dose, and then getting worried that it might not be enough after 1 or 2 hours, then taking more. Many benzos take 2 - 3 hours for full effect. That's real hours on the clock, not perceived hours. And when taking more than necessary, it feels great once it all kicks in, but pushes the tolerance WAY up.

"I have a very similar story. I HAD to do detox for 7 days. Im 45 days clean.  How can you do it w/out detox. You need external support because you WILL call your plug after 10 hours of misery. You need to give your phone to someone, wear it for 48 hours (get sleep aids, benzos if you have to only for the first 2 days). Try and get 4x 8mg strips of suboxone. Once youve hit the 48 hour mark (MINIMUM or youll go through precipitated Withdrawals) take 2mgs of sub. Then every 4 hours another 2mg by the 72nd hour youll feel that you can kinda function. Then keep taking the subs last strip taper it down to 2mg for 2 days, 1Mg For 2 days and so on. Youll look back and youll be free of Fentanyl.

I stopped smoking took my methadone and went right back to working on my sobriety. Point being even if you get so overwhelmed by urges you mess up just drop the fent and get right back on the sober train. That's all that counts. Today I feel better and don't have much desire to use - think that shitty experience got it out of my system. Also in short this should show you that lapses in recovery just suck and are royally not worth it for the high Just some tips on how I dealt with the urge without using for the first 40 days: smoked a ton of THC concentrates.

"So, it could honestly be the fact that you did tea for several days without continuing to consume bupe. I used pod and seed tea for several years after giving up heroin and was back and forth on and off them, subs, and methadone. I learned early on that I could avoid precipitated withdrawal by constantly maintaining a level of buprenorphine in my body. I could skip a day or two but I would then need to take a small dose. I generally would just take a fraction of a milligram on my tea days and go drink my tea and get high and then take the regular dose of bupe the next day. It could be making you feel sort of sick  like that half well and half sick feeling. I just jumped off subs like four weeks ago myself and Ive been on and off them for, God, like a dozen years now  Im not in active withdrawal anymore but the PAWS is shit and Im so damn fatigued all the time. In the past Ive been put on much higher doses of suboxone like you described. This time I made sure to not do that and I maintained at a level of 1.5-3 mg and I have to say there were way less side effects of every kind. But even still, I hate being on the crap. It feels like I just get all the opiate side effects with none of the benefit or high other than taking away my grogginess in the morning. In any case, if you want to bump up the bioavailability because the brand of bupe isnt holding you then you could alter your route of administration. Sublingual < intranasal < rectal < parenteral route. Idk if the brand youre referring to is pills or strips but if its a strip you just gotta mix it with water and snort the solution. Oral syringes are easiest. This might hold you better until you get used to it. But if it is from overdoing the poppy tea then its just something that would resolve with time. I usually dont feel right for several days after initially inducting on subs. And this is even more the case with longer acting stuff like poppy tea or methadone than heroin or oxycodone, for example.  Anyway, hope this helps and you feel better. Just hang in there.

"Less than 1mg of bupe. Youll want to do this. Step 1: hold out as long as possible, taking a kpin will help you with this. Step 2: ideally after 48+ hours has passed start taking 0.5mg chunks of suboxone (1/16th of a   8/2 strip) after taking the 0.5mg chunk wait 40 minutes. If youre symptoms havent gotten WORSE youre safe to take the next 0.5mg chunk and then wait another 40 minutes.  Step 3:Repeat the above process waiting 40 minutes between each chunk. IF YOU EVER FEEL WORSE OFF THEN BEFORE while waiting the 40 minutes to take your next chunk of sub DO NOT TAKE MORE SUBOXONE. You will fuckingregret it big time. Taking the 0.5mg chunks at a time will minimize the possibility of havjnf severe precipitated withdrawals (the worse thing this world has to fucking offer you). Once youve successfully made it to 3mg of suboxone in your system (3/8ths of your strip) by taking 0.5mg and waiting 40 minutes and repeating this 6 times over, then you can take as much sub as you want all at once without fear of precipitated withdrawals since you wouldve had it by now if you were going to get it. Youd probably be safe after 2-2.5mg just to take the rest of the strip too.. but for real I cannot stress this enough do not bomb a whole strip at once because if you did end up taking it too soon, itll be the worst experience of your life. Whereas if you take 0.5mg chunks at a time and shit gets worse atleast its only say for example like 1mg of buprenorphine so it wont be as severe as if you wouldve experienced precip from the whole strip. Also if you do ever feel WORSE instead of better, this is going to sound shitty and yes it sucks but you have to WAIT before taking more. Taking more will only cause it to become worse and worse. Youll want to wait HOURS before trying to take your next small sliver of suboxone if this is the situation you find yourself in. If you take suboxone too soon what happens is the buprenorphine in the strip being only a partial agonist, but having such a strong binding affinity, rips off what fent you have left on your receptors which fent is a full agonist. Replacing a full agonist with a partial agonist is what results in painful as fuck withdrawals that will make you regret life itself my friend. It is not something you ever wish to experience.

"To correct one misperception you might have: The ""4/1 mg"" your psychiatrist mentions does NOT mean it's 1 mg of buprenorphine - it's a combination of 4 mg buprenorphine and 1 mg naloxone. The instructions do indicate using up to 16 mg the first day. That's a pretty high dose. It's true that you *probably* don't need that much for a 40 mg oxycodone habit, which is a fairly manageable detox. It's also true that you'll be quite physically dependent on Suboxone after you make the switch. But it's ridiculous IMO for people to say subs are strictly for people who are constantly relapsing/OD'ing on street drugs. It's nowhere near that cut and dried. Suboxone offers substantial mood support for some people. I'm one of them. Am I still dependent, yes. I also have a pretty good idea how to get off of them when the time comes.  Another thing to consider, if you were getting the oxy for pain management,  subs do offer some people (not all) pretty good pain relief. For most people, it's not easy to get off subs. The Subocade shot seems to work that way for some. They just quit getting the monthly shot, and what's left dissipates so gradually they barely feel any withdrawal. Others taper with strips, get quite low and jump off with fairly mild discomfort.

"I wish that I had some kind of good advice to offer you, but for whatever reason, Im just really lucky. I dont have the slightest clue as to why, but I dont experience PWS if I take buprenorphine just a few hours after a hit of fentanyl. The first time I took Suboxone, I used a whole 8mg film. At the time, Id spent almost an entire day trying to re up after running out of blues, & no luck. About 5-6 hours after Id smoked the last of what I had, I could feel the restlessness of withdrawal start setting in. Id pretty much given up on the hope that I might be able to make a pick up, before I started feeling completely miserable. So, instead I decided that Id cut my losses & take a sub. A buddy of mine had given me three films a while ago, each containing 8mg buprenorphine. I didnt know anything about Suboxone then, but he insisted I should hold onto them  just in case. That night, I slept fine & woke up the next day feeling normal. I was impressed to see how well it was working, & I shared my experience with another junkie friend of mine. I was super confused when he was shocked that I didnt feel like complete shit. I didnt believe him when he told me youre normally supposed to wait 24 hours or more from your last hit before you can take buprenorphine, cuz I took it as soon as my withdrawal symptoms started to creep up, & I felt 100% fine.

"I want you to get a journal. Every night you need to write down EVERYTHING. How angry you are, how happy you are, how it feels like happiness is a dream. Anything and everything. And mark the day and time. Getting it out is the first step. Next I want you to get a notebook, every morning when you wake I want you to write down EVERY SINGLE THING you are about to do and will do later on in ORDER. Your brain is rebuilding connections and getting dopamine and regular endorphins on track. By creating these miniscule lists, and following them to the T studies show your brain will release dopamine and help rebuild important connections. But make sure you put everything. Brush teeth, walk to room, go to closet, pick out shirt,  pick out pants, walk back to room, grab white nikes. Etc etc. Sounds stupid but it freaking works. Lastly this one might sound stupid but you need to do it. When you wake up, SMILE, tell yourself today's going to be amazing. Call someone you love and tell them today's a great day and ask about them. Fake it till you make it surprisingly works during recovery especially when you gets to the further stages of your recovery. You can make it and keep going it sucks. Sometimes we relapse and at other times we need to go through maintenance on buprenorphine or methadone the rest of our lives just to survive. I know that's a grim sounding Outlook which I'm not trying to do but everyone's different, I'm on methadone maintenance and it's made my life finally worth living. Going years with struggling, this fixed me and new studies show methadone maintenance helps rebuild connections while in the program so when I'm ready to wean off and get to 1mg and make the jump, it should be easier. If it doesn't work out I'm not embarrassed to say I may need to go back and maybe even for life. All I know is I'm successful financially and happy where I am with my kids and wife so for me there's no need to change just yet. Where you're at, follow my suggestions above and keep fighting.

"In my experience, buprenorphine does help a lot with pain relief. At the end of the day, it IS still an opioid. It just has almost like a capping effect, so you can't just keep getting higher and higher and higher if you do more and more. It's also has a stronger bond to ur opioid receptors, which is why it kicks other opioids off and doesn't let anything back on until it's out of ur system.

"Tbh the responsible thing would be to at least discuss with doctor, maybe use the Bernese method. If OP shows that they are dedicated to getting clean doctor may provide a comfort med or two - like someone else mentioned clonidine can help immensely.  I'm in the middle of my switch off H using Bernese and tbh it's not that bad yet (going on day 4) plus I have clonidine, valium, and thc carts to use as needed.  So that's another option, although it involves subs it may be the least painful and you'll still be able to get shit done unlike going CT. I was previously using CW and my tolerance was sky high, so I tapered down as much as possible and switched to H once i could get shit without fentanyl.  Once I got to that point it took a few weeks to get everything planned out for my switch off H. That meant making sure I had time off from work, comfort meds, subs, + H to taper off.

"Youre def going to experience some WD, I think you need to be realistic about this. Like others mentioned the best prep would be taper if you can (lower the daily dose, less strong the WD), and get your hands on some comfort meds. If it was me Id start the taper now, do you buy them daily? If so then only buy yourself 1 or 2 everyday for that day so you dont have extra to do, and start thinking about it as taking them just to stay well, no more getting high. Take smaller doses, spanned out longer periods of time (dosing less often). Whether you can taper or not you should def either go to doc or buy off the street comfort meds which could be clonidine, xanex, weed, kratom, suboxone, methadone, gabapentin, something for sleep like trazadoneIm not saying all of this but these are all great options and diff people like diff stuff. Best plan is to be realistic and prepare by getting the meds. Since you work at home Friday and Monday, Id say start the detox Thursday. Thursday as the first day of nothing (since you have gone a day before and been alright it maybe even Wednesday day 1, Thursday day 2) then throughout the long weekend youre home (working Friday/Monday) when youre going thru the worst of it (which is typically between day 2-5, depending on person/habit) youll be in comfort of home and not WD in office. I mean its always better to prep and have things for WD and not need them versus being sick and wishing you had things to help ease the pain, and wish you had prepped better, Good luck!

I agree after some thinking over, more than likely it would be better seeing a professional or going to see my doctor for help. I appreciate the rant I really do. I agree there's a bigger problem and I feel like I know what it is and i could still be wrong. But 1 issue i've always had is saying to myself i'm going to do something and never doing it. I feel like i need to do this, most times where i really have pushed myself to the limit and taken too many wasn't for my surgery pain but just because i felt down and depressed and i felt comfortable being uncomfortable on borderline overdosing because it made me think about nothing else but trying to stay on that thinline at that moment in time. I've got myself away from that mindset as best i can, i'm a much happier person in myself, i'm not 100% there and i have spoken to someone about this and i felt it was a waste of time because they didn't touch on anything i ever felt relevant and i felt awkward the whole time. But i'm much better, i've fixed many issues i have had with myself and this is probably the hardest hurdle i've had to try and get over yet. Like when i take codeine, i feel comfortable at this moment in time i don't because i know im having less but its keeping me from doing more. I just want to feel comfortable without it. I think there's a time limit i need to give myself to completely cut myself off from having anything maybe 7 days and after that i go see my doctor and speak with them about it and just say look i need help i've done my best the past 7 days and if the opposite happens then i'll go straight away and speak with my doctor.

"I know how you feel, I have been in the same position so can really give you some advice. Does your partner know you have codeine addiction? It might help and she can act as support, just let her know your goal is to come off before the baby arrives and use that as an incentive!   Suboxone works really well as it blocks opoid receptors and stops you getting the 'high' feeling from Codeine, it also massively helped me with cravings and I had no problem tapering off that. But you can normally only get it from the doctor (unless you know a dealer/or an online vendor)    Then I went back on Codeine due to a hard time and Covid for 2 years, tried multile times to taper off but always went back to it. Going cold turkey/weaning off is different for everyone, people say going cold turkey rids the body of Codeine quicker but also causes more side effects (depending on the dose you take) Though if you have a supply of Codeine already then going cold turkey is hard because you have to really stop yourself from taking more. Also, I suffered from really bad depression when I went cold turkey and didn't want to get out of bed. I then tried tappering (without doctors, on my own with my partners help) by reducing 1 tablet every week. This saved me because I hardly felt any side effects, it gets hard when you get down to 2 tablets as you don't feel the 'europhia' as much but you have to keep busy and remind yourself why you are doing it. Also try surrounding yourself with comforts that will distract you, like gaming, motivational books, etc.  When I finished tappering I then took Diazepam and Zopcilone as a way to adjust to life without Codeine. I recommend this because it makes the process easier and not as daunting. I use Diazepam for my anxiety whenever I craved Codeine and Zopiclone at night to help me sleep and that is honestly a life saver. Try getting that from the doctor by just saying you have really bad insomnia and have tried everything, say you are going through a hard time and also need Diazepam. If that doesn't work you could also go to an online vendor (just be careful who to trust)  Another alternative is promethazine which I think is available over the counter which helped me with sleep.

Think about bad emotions like a debt, you can ignore them by drowning them with sedatives or other drugs, but eventually you have to pay them in full (with intrest). Each time you have nearly paid off your debt (aka withdrawals subsiding) and you feel yourself wanting to take out a loan (aka relapse) just remind yourself of all the work you have put in so far, and how you would have to do that all over again (and worse).

Not wanting no. But when your already sucking 100 dollars of coke up your face as she was doing that was coming from me. You need me to buy your ciggs put gas in your car buy you weed and not to mention when your already living in my house without paying a dollar for anything the 2 meals a day were her demanding that we go to fucking sakura and longhorn and fuckin Mancys and all these places where for 2 it cost 60-80 dollars each time. The point I was making is she had no concept or reality. When your doing drugs and needing all these things everyday to get by you gotta understand you cant also spend 150 a day on eating out.

I'd love nothing more than to go get some again, but fuck it I'm going to see where this sobriety train takes me.... I def know where the Fent train is heading. How much does that cost you, 12-15 dirty 30s a day? Are you snorting them? ",2022-03-18T16:07:16+00:00,"dirty 30s, Fent, dirty 30s",

Now my tricep is half an inch shorter and you can imagine the issues that causes. In short Im in lovely WD as I type to yourself. 2 years on pharma and dirty 30s. Ironic day to start this.

"I was doing 2 of the dirty 30s a day, snorted... Which I think was a lot. For 2months straight... And I was doing them every other weekend before that for years. WDs - 3 days to peak. 4th day I got relief. Currently on day 8 and life is amazing!  You'll be fine by next Saturday...YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THAT for the next 4 days Sunday - Thursday. You cannot trust your brain in the first 4 days. It'll find anyway possible into tricking you into thinking you need more, you maybe you should taper down, or maybe you should get some Suboxone. You just have to ride the hell train for a few days. You can do this. It sucks. But once you hit day 4 you've fucking won, all downhill from there. Might be less severe for you since you're not doing straight Fent like I was.

These dirty 30s are no fucking joke. Everything might be going fine right now but this isn't sustainable long term man.. Just like with dope theres too many variables that make doing dirty 30s really hard to do consistently long term, even with as much money as you need, things can happen like new batches being too strong or the source drying up, etc. Quit while your ahead man.

"I totally understand how you feel, I relapsed the first time after day 6 on dirty 30s (using kratom), then I started again and relapsed on day 8 (using kratom). Then I got clean for 35 days and relapsed last Thursday and felt so much shame, guilt, and hopelessness. I know the negative feelings and beating myself up is something I can't handle - I have numbed any pain I had for almost 3 years with opiates!! So I think it is important to focus on the 19 days clean you did get. You cannot erase the strength and determination it took to get there, you suffered through hard, difficult days and that is amazing. We cant punish ourselves, we will never win this battle if we do. When you are on this journey, you will have a slip and fall but you have to get back up quickly and fight before you are run right over! Today, I am back on day 6 and moving forward-thinking of the endless possibilities that are available if I keep going, while still remembering and trying to drill in my brain that the pain of slipping and knowing it isn't worth it so I stay encouraged to fight this fight. I am cheering you on as we fight this fight together. ",2022-02-23T14:15:42+00:00,"dirty 30s, kratom, kratom, opiates","hopelessness, pain"
"3 months clean. Grabbed 2 dirty 30s. Did one to the face with dealer in my car. Don't remember how I got home but I drove into a ditch. Dad had to pick me up and had car towed. Dents on both sides of my car. Did another dirty 30 to the face thinking I totaled my car (only about 20 minutes after the first one.) Died in the bathroom butt naked. Little sister had to call 911 and do CPR. Woke up to 5 cops surrounding me and one holding my naked body up so I could vomit. Took 4 narcan. That was December 1, 2020 and I haven't used since.

I just had a newborn Im at this age where Im just so ready to be healthy,  I know Ill always be an addict if not forever itll be awhile.  But idk Im ready I can feel it in my bones.  Never looking back this past withdrawal was the worst Ive ever had. Even with comfort meds.  The cloud came back towards the end of the night at the bowling alley everything was awesome people yelling having a good time i go to the restroom pissing at the wall and it hits me Im always gonna be this way I have made my body sick with addiction.. but its okay because I have support and willpower hope and faith.

It was full blown mental withdrawals and moderate physical. And yes. Dont do the crime if you cant do the time ya know? Ive found that I can do like 3-5 dirty 30s in a single day and not suffer withdrawals but only if Im on subs.

"so the intense part of the trip lasts about 12 hours, followed by lingering psychedelic effects for 2-3 days.  the first 12 hours are unlike any other psychedelic. you are completely aware and conscious the whole time, but when you close your eyes it produces full visuals beyond what you can imagine. you arent gone or in it like when on dmt, but its more like youre watching some crazy dream. then during this time your mind is just thinking so fast and breaking down things in a super logical and heightened kinda way, which is unlike anything else.  2-3 days after is kinda similar to lsd with things being wavy and breathing and stuff like that. but by that point youre just so physically and mentally exhausted that you cant wait for it to stop lol. EDIT: i would also just add that the whole experience is physically exhausting as well. my stomach was fucked and i couldnt sleep for days. it wasnt necessarily like being dope sick because i knew doing opiates literally wouldnt be an option so it wasnt on my mind like that. it felt more like it was getting rid of all the toxins and scrubbing the poison out of my brain and body.  i was able to eat normal food again after about a week and then sleep normally after a couple weeks. by like the 4 week mark i felt as good, if not better, than i did before using both mentally and physically. those first 2 weeks was honestly one of the toughest experiences of my life though.

Using at an early age for years really screwed me . I recently passed my 8 year clean mark and Im still never as genuinely happy as I was before dope.

"You totally have a right to be upset about this situation girl! Dealing with a loved ones addiction is horrible and difficult, and since I've had an ex and have a best friend w BPD, I'm somewhat familiar with it and I know that that must make it even harder. But you have 110% made the right decision here. I know how much it hurts to leave someone that you still love a lot, but when you end up losing your whole self to this person, that's when it's time to pack it up and go. I don't know you, but I know you have potential, skills, goals and hopes and dreams- and I'm pretty damn sure that just from what you wrote, having this man by your side and having to deal with his chaotic lifestyle is NOT conducive to you living the life you want, whatever that may be.   I know it must hurt right now. Don't beat yourself up for being upset- give yourself a few days to mourn the relationship. Take a bath with a bath bomb, order your favorite take out food, watch a movie that makes you happy cry. And after that, write out a list of all the things in your life that you'll now be able to do/not have to worry about, now that you're not devoting a decent amount of your mind to worrying/thinking about your ex and his addiction. If you need a reminder not to go back, take it from me- when people get off dope and jump straight to getting drunk all the time, the results are NEVER good, they often end up getting annoying and pathetic at best and abusive at worst, and you do not need that in your life homegirl.   You got this. Stay strong and stay away from him.

That's when I realized how withdrawal is totally mental that manifests itself physically.  I don't think people think about when they give someone an amount of days until they are well again there mind becomes set on that and could actually be sabotaging their recovery.

"""Can't trust your own brain"" is literally the pathology of the disease, though, it's not some spiritual pseudoscience. Addiction/Alcoholism don't affect your cortex...which is why they are all but immune to clinical therapy and similar approaches. This shit rewires your midbrain, which a part of your mind you really don't have control over. It's the part that can hijack your frontal cortex in a life-and-death situation, it absolutely can and does override your willpower. This is what it means to be an addict. If you can have a drink poured in front of you or a line of dope set in front of you and not do it, you're not an addict. If your willpower can keep you clean, you don't have the disease. Now, does spirituality fix that? I don't claim to know. I think there's a lot going on that helps people who work the steps.  Also, the Big Book itself says ""There are many ways to recovery, we know but a little"". Nothing in the actual program says ""You will die without this"". ",2022-03-07T21:33:11+00:00,dope,

"Morning y'all! Dirty D I hope your plane ride went alright- ive been flying since I was 6months old (95% of my family lives overseas) but I still get scared shitless every time im in a plane taking off or landing, so I totally get being freaked tf out by it.   Anyways. Im still in bed rn, cuz these last few weeks been hectic and I deserve a goddamn lie in. I'm taking R out for dinner for his bday today, but before that I gotta go get some groceries. Sounds like a chill day, but lately I've been so stressed and slightly overwhelmed by just getting stuff done- it's all gotten done, but it's been exhausting- that I feel like today is just yet another day I have to be like perfect and on point and can't relax. Idk why, and I'm trying my best to find a good mental balance of keeping up the momentum of pushing myself to get things done even when I feel like I physically and mentally can't vs making sure my brain is still in a decent place, but it's hard.   My apocalypse anxiety still isn't really alleviated by any means, although ofc it's better than it was on Sunday where I pretty much had a minor panic attack. I talked to my dad for like an hour- I'm really grateful that after a shitty relationship with my parents for almost my whole life, now I can talk to both of them about almost anything (something my childhood self could've never in a billion years imagined) and they'll be, for the most part, supportive and chill. Talking to him helped cuz his mind is very similar to mine and despite also having anxiety he's an intelligent and rational person, but he said something about me seeming kinda lonely when I was visiting them that stuck out to me.   Basically he said that he sensed that I was somewhat lonely, and one of the only things other than a good friend group and supportive work environment that can alleviate these kinds of worries about the future is a good life partner with whom you feel comfortable about facing potential dangers ahead together. Never thought I'd see the day where my father was telling me to get a man lmao.   And I mean sure, he has a point, but I think instead of loneliness what he sensed from me was more of the fact that for the first time in my life I'm really comfortable with and at times happy about spending time alone. My father has always known me as an extremely social person, who sought mental refuge in the distraction of other people. That's definitely not who I am anymore. Don't get me wrong, I still am extroverted at the end of the day, and I do still enjoy and value the company of others, but being alone (not like single even [but that too lol], just literally alone for even just a day) used to be my worst fear and now it's something that I actually cherish greatly.   Like I think a huge part of why I did drugs- not just dope, but booze too and weed back when weed was a problem for me- is because I was so shit scared of just sitting alone with my sober mind. I had no control over the void and felt as if if I were to spend even a few minutes just silently contemplating my own mind, I would fall backwards into a place I could never come out of. So a big part of recovery for me has been learning how to not just be okay with sitting alone and sober, but how to actively enjoy doing so.   And i think that so far, so good. It sounds cheesy af but i love hanging out with myself and having conversations and debates and making stupid jokes with myself. The only person you can ever fully guarantee will always be with you is YOU,  so you'll never have an enjoyable life if you can't, when you need to, be your own best friend and enjoy your own company. If it gets misconstrued as loneliness, so what. I'm happy, and that is what counts.   Anyways. I gotta get going, my dumb lil dog is whining to be walked and idw make her wait.

I went to my old psych doctor i saw a couple years ago. I went in and told her exactly what was going on. Bare bones all the facts. I was using and wanted some non narcotic meds to get off the dope. I blantly told her I had done my research and came to conclude that clonidine gabapentin and seraquel would be enough to get my through the worst. She said she had no problem writing those meds for me and offered Zofran as well for my stomach. We then talked about a few more personal things and I scheduled to see her again in a month.  I have heard you can also go to a ER and most will prescribe these or some like them. Clonidine is a very old and safe blood pressure medication that does miracles for withdrawl if you let it. Gabapentin at 1200mg to 1800mg a day will also help a ton. And the seraquel is for sleep. 50mg will knock you the fuck out no matter what. Ypu take it and 30 mins later you're done. Its less effective for sleep at higher doses. ,2022-04-18T19:17:30+00:00,"dope, clonidine gabapentin, seraquel, Zofran, Clonidine, Gabapentin, seraquel","sleep, sleep"

"Morning y'all. My 3 years is coming up in like 3 days, ik it's cliche to say but it feels like a long ass time but also the blink of an eye all at once. I often feel like nothing has changed, cuz I was living in this same apt when I was using and then kicked, I started working for my current company when I was only a month clean, and I was with R back then and still am now, but actually a lot has changed.   My shitty lil apartment is no longer a junkie looking mess, I have a real living room with nice furniture, two TVs and internet, a real bed with a new mattress, and I routinely deep clean. I started at my job as a server on two crappy weeknight shifts for the least popular restaurant of my company and was constantly scared of getting in trouble/fired and walked on eggshells around the higher ups, now I'm the assistant manager of the most successful restaurant in my company, am literally the exact same person at work that i am on my days off, and am super close homies with the directors of the company. And I won't get into stuff with R too much, but between his newer self awareness and my newer ability to set and enforce boundaries, things have been pretty damn good.   When I write it all out like that it really does put things in perspective- I had therapy 2 days ago and I was talking to her about how I feel weirdly stagnant, like ive never in my life before this done the same thing for even a year straight, let alone 3 years straight. But my therapist was right, I have actually made a lot of progress, even if it doesn't necessarily seem like that at first glance. And that's not even mentioning the progress I've made when it comes to my mental state, mainly with my CPTSD, addiction, and the intersection of those two things.   Even though the future ahead is looking pretty scary, seeing how much I've been able to achieve in 3 years- while not an insane or notable amount of successes, still a pretty decent amount of progress in life in general- gives me more hope that I'll be able to achieve what I want to get done in the next 3 years. Kids might be another 5 years or so (I won't lie, getting another half decade in where I still have the option to like sleep in and lay in bed on my phone sounds pretty dope despite how much I do love kids lol) but a house, despite this wildly fucked market, is hopefully doable before I'm 30.   Seeing the rest of you on this sub, esp the OGs that have been posting since well before I kicked, do those things like buying a house or having a child or getting a big promotion, helps to give me hope. My impostor syndrome has become less and less noticeable these last few months, but I do still have moments of feeling like I'm faking living a normal person life. Seeing examples of other ex junkies not just getting their shit together, but actually succeeding in building the life they really want, helps me feel like it's not that far fetched that I could do it, too.   Well lemme wrap this up. I wanted to get my nails done today but the salon is booked up  I'm off on Fridays now, for the first time in YEARS, and i honestly hate it. On my other days off i could always get an appt day of lol. Even though im off today, we have a chef pop up event thing at work that I booked, and since I've been homegirls liason since I initially reached out to her about doing this at my work like 2 months ago, I'd feel like a dickhead if it's the day of the event and all of a sudden I'm nowhere to be found, so I figure I'll go in for like an hour and a half just to help her set up and get situated- and to buy some food cuz her stuff is banging and I've been looking forward to eating it lol- is prob the right move. I hate going in on my days off though, not cuz I don't wanna be at work, I like my work and my coworkers are my homies, but cuz I always feel guilty seeing them working when I'm not lol.   Alright y'all. I hope everyone is doing alright today and enjoying this nice weather we're having out east. There's something about kicking dope in early spring that I feel makes it easier- as you're finally clawing your way out of addiction, ~new life~ (lol so cheesy but still) is clawing its way out of the winter. That first day that you don't feel so bad, and you go outside and it's tshirt weather and the sun hits your face and you realize you feel something unfamiliar-an actual good mood? - is the kind of moment that shows you that huh, maybe I can actually stick with this. For anyone in those first few days/ weeks, I hope you have a day like that today.  ",2022-04-15T16:42:10+00:00,"dope, dope",mood

"I second all of this immensely; this is great advice. I don't want to discourage you OP, but you most likely will not feel better enough to go to class by day 6.   The thing about addiction, as this commenter has said, is that it literally physically breaks your brain. After using for a while, you have rewired all your Neural pathways to point to dope. Even once you are over the initial physical wd symptoms, the mental ones will remain, as will the intense cravings, which are near to impossible to ignore when they get bad enough.   The only way to alleviate this is to get to the root of why you felt like you had to start using in the first place. Most of us (if not all of us) use in order to fill a void in our brains. The work we've gotta all do after getting clean is figuring out what that void is- what initially caused it to open, what caused it to get wider to the point you couldn't ignore it any more, what kinds of non-drug things you can start using to fill the void in lieu of dope, and eventually how you can diminish the existence of the void in your mind itself.   You can quit dope, but if you don't get to the root of WHY you have addictive behavior patterns in the first place, you'll just end up replacing dope with something else, and you'll still be spinning the wheel to fill the void. I know this all sounds very daunting, but trust me it is possible. I used to shoot a bundle and a half a day but ive now been off dope for 3 years. MAT may be of assistance to you- I personally am on suboxone, which helps to physically rewire those Neural pathways while you work on just bettering your life and your mental state. Definitely take the above commenters advice and try to see a professional.   Things will be rough for the next few weeks, but you're absolutely doing the best possible thing you could do for yourself. Getting clean this young will make your life so much easier.

Better things await you soon man, getting out of a shitty work environment is such a relieving and honestly liberating feeling, even if you haven't got another job immediately lined up.   Anyways. Yall, it finally happened yesterday. Something that, in my now 3 years (in 8 days!) of being off dope, I knew would occur at some point considering my city is the dope capital of the US.   I got on the train to go home from work yesterday, and right underneath the seat I'm sitting in I notice a fanny pack. I picked it up Cuz I thought it might have someone's wallet in it and if so I was gonna look at their ID and try and mail the thing back to them. First thing I see is an unopened suboxone in the front pocket and I'm like oookay. So I open the main pocket and in it is a thing of hand lotion, some mascara, two things of narcan nasal spray, aaaaand two baggies of dope, one opened, but both FULL. I straight up took them out and held them up against the light to see if there was anything in there lmao, ofc I had zero intention of doing anything with them but ya know the junkie part of me that still exists just had to SEE if there was anything in them lmao.   So. I put the fanny pack back down under the seat and honestly had a visceral reaction after seeing the dope and like kicked it away from me and shuddered- I was going towards my neighborhood, which although lower income doesn't really have many junkies out and about, which meant I couldn't do what I would've done if I was headed the opposite way towards work which is find some random junkie in the train station and give them the bags. That was honestly my first thought, cuz I want nothing to do with dope but someone whos strung out ain't gonna just magically stop being strung out so giving it to them prolly would've made their day- and there's also the addicty part of my brain that still hates to see drugs go to waste; even if it's not me doing any of them lol.   I told R about it Cuz we were already texting and he was like what if a kid finds it, throw that shit away, and I was like ehh I guess but I kinda doubt any mom is gonna let their kid start rifling through a random fanny pack on the floor of public transit (although tbh stranger things have happened ), and I'll be honest I also didn't even wanna carry the damn thing off the train with me even just to drop it in the nearest trash bag- and okay, I'll admit, a small part of me wanted to leave it on the train so maybe some dopesick junkie could find it.   So I got off at my stop and just left it there on the train, and as I got off this younger kid, maybe 17 or so, got on, sat in the seat where I was at, and the last thing I saw before getting off was him noticing the fanny pack and reaching down to grab it. He just looked like some normal kid from the neighborhood, prob drinks a lil and almost def smokes weed, but likely nothing more. But I'm just now realizing that maybe I fucked up; cuz what if that kid was like me wren I was a teenager- not yet strung out, but willing to try whatever type of drug cuz fuck it right? Opiates have also become a worse and worse problem within the community I live, with a lot of kids starting off with pressed percs thinking they basically the same as weed, and not realizing they're addictive until one day they don't take any and start to get sick.    Now a part of my brain is kinda worried. I really hope that kid saw what was in there, rolled his eyes when he realized there wasn't nothing valuable, and put it back on the floor. But also, kids ain't dumb, and he could know that he could most likely sell the dope, therefore keep it, then end up not being able to sell it and forget about it, then find it in his drawer months later when he's bored and looking for weed or something and be like hey, why not just try some of this? Fuck man, now I feel guilty and like I should've listened to R. Maybe he meant kid as in teenager, and not little kid, and that just went over my head. Idk.   Either way, I'm def proud of myself for not for one second even contemplating potentially doing it, cuz even a year or two ago I might've had a moment of weakness where I at least considered possibly tryna fuck with it (esp summer 2020 when I was so burnt out and mentally fucked up that I would legit wish to find baggies on the ground so I'd have an excuse to say fuck it and get high). I honestly can't really believe that it took 3 years for this to happen, cuz I'll be honest I do look out on the ground for weird shit, mostly drugs but also money n other weird valuable things, since growing up in a huge city meant I often did find really random cool shit on the ground (and being a teenage drug addict meant that many a time I'd find random pills on the ground and look them up only for them to be opiates/stims/benzos and my day would be made lmao).   These are prob the first years of my entire non- little kid life that I have been able to find free drugs (esp my DOC) and say ew hell no. That little voice in the back of my head that used to (even when i wasn't actively using) be like ""well hey you don't have to do it now, just hold onto it, you never know, might come in handy, you've done so good, just treat yourself you deserve it"" just doesn't even exist anymore, which is crazy. Shoutout to suboxone too cuz I'll admit any inkling of the previously mentioned internal voice was instantly shut down by the fact that I wouldn't even get high if I did any of it. (And okay, I'll be honest, the fact that all dope here is fent w no actual heroin and 90% of it now has weird unknown tranquilizers in it to boot didn't hurt w making me not wanna do it either, lol).   But anyways, lemme wrap this long ass shit up. I did yoga in the morning before work 3 days in a row this last week (couldn't on Sunday cuz I had to be in at the time I normally wake up) cuz I'm tryna make it a habit that sticks to the point where I feel like I can't leave my house unless I do it. So I'm about to walk my dog then do like 20min of yoga. I've realized the whole ""I'm too tired to do it"" excuse doesn't even make sense cuz after you do it you feel sooo much more awake.   Alrighty y'all. Hope everyone is doing alright. If you're in those first few days, weeks, or months, and feeling like staying off dope is completely unsustainable, just remember as time passes and you keep doing what you're doing it gets easier, cuz if someone who was once as bad as me can now find two full baggies and say fuck that, anyone definitely can.

What I realised is that once withdrawal symptons kick in your not going to just have a small bump and feel better. You need to saturate your receptors again for major relief.  What is better is to slowly reduce by a small amount, like 10%. I have done this before when I was using pills which was easier since the dosages were easier to gauge. I split my doses out for each day and try to limit myself to dosing twice a day, once in the morning (small does), then again around 6pm (larger dose) which is when i'm usually feeling the worst of the withdrawal symptoms coming on. Honestly though you'll slip sometimes so I leave a few extra doses as ""backup"" so I don't get too disheartened and blow through the whole lot in an evening. The next g I buy i'm going to try to hold out for 8-9 days then going cold turkey. If I don't get through that it's ok i'll buy another 1g and try and ride that out for 10-11.  I have been taking zopilcone and some other things for sleeping at night which makes it much easier. Oh and immodium is a must for your stomach! Hope that helps and good luck!

"That's a good question tbh. I'm usually fairly nice to myself these days, but sometimes I feel like I need to be meaner to myself otherwise I won't be ""tough"" anymore or some stupid bullshit like that. But I guess letting myself be sad about some shit that's an 11 year old problem (albeit a pretty big problem) is being nice to myself, kinda.   That problem would be my old homie who's been missing since may 2011. The first kid I ever met in the punk scene, back when he was 17 and I was 13. That was in 2008; its coming up on 14 years since I met him and my life changed forever. If it wasn't for meeting him (and him being my first kiss and me developing a HUGE crush on him, I should say, lol) I wouldn't have gotten into the punk scene, and through a long chain of events I maybe wouldn't have started doing dope (although I kinda doubt that, I think I would've ended up a junkie even if I did turn out ""normal"", it just might've taken a longer time idk). But I don't regret meeting him for a single second. I don't really regret any of my life, honestly, despite all the insanity and hell I've been through.   Anyways. Its grey and rainy outside, similar to the weather around the time I first met this kid. I always get weirdly nostalgic this time of year. Except this year, it'll be the 14th anniversary, and I was only 13 when all this happened. It's been longer since it happened than how long i was alive for at the time that it did. Which is wild. And speaking of long times, the longer someone's been missing for, the more the chances of finding them (not even alive, just finding them at all) Go down exponentially year after year.   It may seem silly, but sometimes I'll be out in the world and I'll see someone who looks similar to him and my mind will instantly jolt, then I'll look for his tattoos and realize it obviously isn't him. He did grow up right across the river from my city and had 7 siblings, so I could very well at times be seeing one of his little brothers. But they know as much about where he is as I do, if not even less.   I have extremely little hope for him being alive, of course. But I just wanna know. I just wanna know what happened to him. The older I get, the more the years of my life where he and the rest of the old punk kids crew was around for fades into rough edged memories. That's life, I guess. But something about this makes me so sad. I'm used to having friends who live on the fringes of society (and to doing so myself). But the older I get, the more I realize that this- having a good homie go missing without a fucking trace, and just NEVER be seen again or have any remains found after over a decade- is RARE,  even for a scene full of people who disappear in and out of society.   There's no way to end this post on a reasonably happy note, lol. But idk. These days, with this kind of grey rainy spring weather, always bring me back to being a kid in my home city, in this weird way. I'm glad I'm still friends w ppl who were with me during those times, 10-14 years ago, and can reminisce about them with me, but the more time goes on, the more homeboys existence fades into scraps of memories at the bottom of the filing cabinets in people's minds... and that makes me sad.

You should listen to what different people say. You don't necessarily need rehab to get off dope if you really want. You could do mat. I know you did methadone but maybe try subs.  You don't even need mat. U could do clonadine or benzos to help with withdrawal while you try to sleep it off at home.

"Man, the hometown effect is real! I spent my first two months of sobriety in the town I did all my dope in.

If it werent for my gf, subs & weed, I would have relapsed with out question. I finally moved to a new place where I had zero associations with any opiates (I did have one friend who used there but he odd within a weeks of my arrival). The two days I had to go back to my old apartment to move out, I hit up both my plugs & thank god one got arrested & was sober, & the other declined to give me something. I was there for 12 hours before trying to score, after 3 straight months on the straight & narrow, not thinking about getting my fix once.  Its now my 347th day sober, & Ive since moved to a new place where Ive never used, on route to graduate college, work 30 hours a week at a vape shop, picked skateboarding back up, & accepted an offer for a sales job post graduation.

"Drink lots of water up until the test. Push yourself to drink as much as possible. The day of your urine test, drink 3 large glasses of water an hour or two before the test.

This is incorrect. Dont give advice when you obviously have no experience in the matter. If someone takes your advice thats been on fent they will go into precipitated withdrawal immediately.

We got a half g bag and only divied up half of it 3 ways. So idk how little of an amount I did. But I was so fcked up, if I did any more I would've fallen out for sure.

"From what I understand, fent analogs are pretty varied and you aren't going to know what you've been getting short of sending a sample oit to a lab for a test. Different analogs have different severity of effects because they remain in your system/fat cells for different periods of time, plus some are more ""effective"" than others, so that can also impact your experience.  If you taper with your pharmacy grade you should be fine, but I'd expect to be uncomfortable for a couple weeks of you've been doing this a long time. Oxy (the real stuff) is harsh as hell on the receptors. I've noticed other than the aches and pains initially present, the biggest issue is restlessness/RLS, insomnia and irritability. You can take things to help with that.  My preferred way to come off longterm oxy use (I have to do this a few times a year for medical reasons) is:  Taper down until at 10mg a few times a day, then jump off.  A few days to a week before, start introducing low doses of Kratom, higher doses of Vitamin C, and regular therapeutic doses of St John's Wart and Ashwaganda root (those three can be found at aby drug store). Keep taking through the WDs, but increase the kratom to a medium dose, as needed.   Take 10mg of melatonin at night, about an hour or two before bed (this works better than right before bed).  If you can get other comfort drugs that's cool. Benzos help a lot of people but I usually don't use them, despite having them. I'd just monitor your anxiety, but I think feeling a bit anxious during the process is normal. All about your personal experience here. Muscle relaxers are great, too, and can be bought at most overseas pharmacies without a prescription. I'm not talking soma or anything, just tizanidine or something similar. Helps with the spasms that are super common with ox ly WD.  Loperimide is useful for any stomach issues, but be careful with it. Don't take too much and I usually let myself have the stomach problems foe a day or two because I've been constipated for so long.  Otherwise, just use self care. The above will help with synptoms, including mood, but having things to distract you (stay away from friends who use!) Is good. I like to take the time to write, read, go places I usually don't, take long walks. Even little things, like buying this super expensive tea I don't usually buy, but love, and getting pastries from this fancy af bakery.  Oh, and sugar! Sugar is a cheap dopamine hit.

I was using some type of fent analogue last year. My dealer had the same stuff for over a year. I ended up quitting cold turkey aside from some gabapentin. A few days passed and I still wasn't feeling much WDs. A week went by and still nothing as far as WD. Ended up being 2 weeks later and still felt alright. The numerous times I tried to quit before on other types of dope it was hell but for some reason this time I didn't get any WDs.  The stuff my dealer had def would get you high.

The closest thing to a magic bullet is methadone/ subs and they come with their own side effects as well as the fact you need to withdraw/ taper from those also. Further to getting over acute WD addicts need to address the reasons they got addicted in the first place and what kept them there. Even if ibogaine did what it said on the tin, which it does not, it would not be a cure.

Did I snort them,yes I did, but I also did a short taper,and haven't touched anything since. I don't even consider that a slip up,as it was special circumstances... I worked WAAYYY to hard to get here. Getting clean and staying clean always comes down to how badly you want it and need to give 110% every time. Ibuprofen and Tylenol don't act on your opiate receptors...I wouldn't recommend kratom to ya,even though it's amazing for pain. It's from the coffee family and isn't an opiate but it DOES play with the mu opioid receptor...that stuff kept me sober for 4 yrs and I stopped taking it again and proceeded to get messed up for another 3 5 yrs Wildlettuce is another alright one for pain relief. If it's back muscle pain robaxcin is amazing. None of these are opiates and don't get you high or make you crave...they just help dull the pain out a bit.

In order to avoid fent withdrawals and who knows else is cut into those pills, I have the luxury of a plan B : To switch from pressed 30s to REAL pharmacy OC 80s for about a week. I believe this would give my body enough time to totally rid itself of the fentanyl while not getting sick because Id still be taking opiates. Then, after a week of using only the pharmacy OxyContin, I stop cold turkey and deal with regular OxyContin withdrawals as I have before, making it safer to take a sub once in high on the COWS scale.

Yeah eventually youre taking that stuff just to not be sick. Its an expensive way to feel normal.  I went cold turkey from fent and had sleeping issues for atleast 90 days. I didnt sleep at all the first week or two. Try tryptophan at night and 5htp during the day with like 2gs of l-phenylalanine every couple hours during acute wd. Also exercising will massively improve sleep quality and general well being. I know it sucks to do and can seem impossible with the lack of energy but its what you gotta do.  Getting off opiates takes work everyday. 2-3 weeks flys by when youre high all the time but feels like an eternity going through detox. Either go the MAT route or bite the bullet and keep pushing through making daily lifestyle changes. Let me tell you there is an end to the pain. It will be a year for me next month and while I do think about it almost daily Im back to laughing and finding joy in my day to day.

"Yes and no. If she was on fent, she will have some withdrawals after a couple of days but the cravings will be gone. Fent just stays in the system a lot longer than oxy so the ibogaine will knock out the withdrawals for a couple days but then they come on. They wont be as bad as cold turkey, though. I would estimate mine were about 20-30% of normal withdrawals. Worst part was the RLS and insomnia. I still had zero desire to use during that time, even though I could have.

And I can't bring myself to take the risk of leaving my children without a mother. It's crazy to know now that we can actually live day to day without getting high. I also quit all hard drugs when I quit using fent. Which I also never expected to do either, but it just happened. I also keep telling myself on my bad days.. ""if I made it this many days, then I can make it one more day."" And then the craving passes and I go back to normal afterwards. I just wanna say too, the hardest parts for me by farrrr were the first week and the first 30 days. So congrats on making it four weeks!! That's a really big deal & If it were easy, then everyone would be doing it. For me, it got easier as time went on. And my life is nothing like it used to be, which is great. I actually can't imagine doing half the shit I did during active addiction again. It's almost like a past life at this point. But keep up the good work and keep going!!

When I first started I was eating 1 or 2 5s feeling fabulous. Then it progressed. By the time I was sniffing 30s before going to OxyContin I was up to like 6-8 a day.

Yeah sorry man. I was just trying to lay out a realistic timeline for you based on what I went through. It sounds like your habit was similar to mine. I was using IV every 2 hours or less daily all day. I kept reading that withdrawal would be done in 10 days. Made me think I was in too deep or that I'd never feel ok again. I'd rather have known what I was up against but I can see how that could be terrifying too. Once you get through those first few weeks it really is soooo much better. Don't be hopeless. You really gotta do what's best for you. Getting clean or at least off fent is the most important thing for you. MAT may be your best option but really if you wanna quit you just gotta do it. I feel like the fact that it was so bad actually helped me realize how fucking bad my addiction was and reenforced my decision to quit and not keep digging the hole.  If your really about doing this. You probably gonna have to get to a place where you can take a few weeks off and have someone to help you get through it. If that's not possible the MAT is probably the way to go. A lot of people use gabapentin and clonidine instead of methadone/Suboxone. They work wonders for withdrawal symptoms. Be strong.

Personally cold turkey pressed fent pills was absolute anguish. Never again. The worst wd I've ever had.

God have mercy on your friend. The good thing is that this experience being so horrible may draw your friend closer to being clean. Im a little over a month off fent and when I get cravings I remember how horrible and traumatic it was coming off. Some jails do take patients to methadone clinic though. The best recommendation is to take advantage of that AND/ OR have your friend tell the jail she is an alcoholic or benzo addict as well. They will most likely give comfort meds for that which will also help with opioid withdrawal since quitting alc/benzos are dangerous and pose a risk of death. The jails usually understand that.

"I tried the Bernese method with a high dose habit and could never successfully get off the last day at 12mg.

you're on a high amount of fent so taking methadone for a few days won't really help at all. you'll still be sick as shit once u stop it. you don't have many choices at this point. once u get to that level of fent tolerance u lose a lot of the options people suggest like kratom. you need rehab man to at least safely transition on to subs and stay on those a couple months to a year. you're not living right and just because u cut the drugs doesn't mean it gets better u need time 2 fix things. montha onMAT or rehab are really your only options now.

"I'm so sorry you're going through this. I went through something slightly similar. I stopped using but the metabolite for fent (norfentanyl) lingered in my system for a few MONTHS from this 1 lab. The other two places I took drug tests weekly, (3 places all together) showed norfentanyl left after a few weeks. Id even pee 2 places on the same day. One would say positive for norfent the other would say negative. All of them watched me pee too. Luckily they were testing the levels so they saw it going down and saw I never introduced anything new into my system. But I got so depressed at one point. Like why am I putting in this hard work if I'm gonna get accused of using anyways? First time in my adult life I was actually not using. And to make matters worse, it was piss tests for family treatment drug court, to get my son back. Which I did, everything worked out, and it eventually left my system. But I just know how you feel. Is there a different clinic near you that you could go to? I'd look into finding another methadone clinic if I were you. Or if not, maybe switching to suboxone. But again, somewhere else. My clinic does subs and methadone so idk if yours does too. But try and hang in there. ",2022-03-23T23:06:32+00:00,"fent, methadone, suboxone, subs, methadone",depressed

I didn't want to but was a stupid people pleaser who wanted him to like me, so I did. I think we never talked about what to do if things go south, ""It'll be fine, my tolerance can handle it"", he said. I was at his place (he lived with his parents) and it was like a bit outside of any city, I estimate it would've taken 20 mins for an ambulance to get there. He nodded out and stopped breathing, like at all, lips turned blue. I read somewhere that opioids only suppress the respiratory system but do not much to the heart (?), and that exhaled air still contains way enough oxygen to be enough to survive off. And I knew that fent is really short-lived so I decided to just do mouth to mouth until he breathed on his own again, as I was shitting my pants about what he and his parents later on would do if I called an ambulance. It was pure terror, and I probably made a highly irresponsible decision, but it worked.. after about 45 minutes of doing that, he finally started doing his own breaths again, like once per minute, so I continued until I felt he was breathing enough. (I continuously checked his heartrate too). Later on I was able to wake him up, he mumbled something but fell asleep again. At that point I left, was totally mortified about the whole thing and was a bit pissed at him for putting me in this situation if he wasn't 100% sure his tolerance was high enough. Next time we spoke he just said ""Ohh, I always sleep that way"". lol told him about his blue lips and his many minutes of absolutely not one breath (while I was panicking before I started the mouth-to-motuh) and that he'd surely have braindamage if he would ""always sleep that way"" or had I just waited.

You're saying you don't think is a good idea, but this is trending quickly in the medical field and studies have shown (I linked one) that over 3,000 people have done this with a high success rate.

Have you ever heard of this or no?  To your point though...RIGHT ON!  But when I got sober from fent 5 months ago...my tolerance was SO HIGH from fent...that I spent $1,270 on real oxy.  I had plenty of REAL perc 30's.  I figured...do these for 6 days and  I won't be high..but I won't be sick either.  NOPE.  It did NOT keep me from being really sick.  I didn't even feel the oxy.  I was snorting 120mg of real oxy (K-9's) and it would take away the RLS and help me stop sweating for a little bit...but my energy was in the dirt and I couldn't even get the strength to shower.  I was snorting and taking orally over 600mg of oxy a day and I was still in rough shape and couldn't get out of bed and eat.  THAT IS HOW STRONG THIS FENT SHIT IS!!!!

Lots of places are realizing fent is fucking things up really bad and theyve got to do something different. It can take 5 days before you can take subs with certain types of fentanyl and when someone has a really high tolerance thats brutal.  I have a buddy that owns a few detoxes and they started using morphine to taper fent patients because they kept having people AMAing or bugging the fuck out and having to go to the hospital (which means the detox dont get paid while theyre there lol). And when youre on a really high dose of fent like that then youd need an insane amount of morphine or oxy or methadone to get high. Like hundreds of milligrams. So it really just takes the edge off and makes it bearable. ,2022-04-21T16:08:28+00:00,"fent, subs, fentanyl, morphine, fent, fent, morphine, oxy, methadone",

The people you love and who love you will help you but only if you help yourself. Get all the necessary supplies and comfort meds and commit to it. During withdrawals make sure you feel that shit and remember it well. It will pass if you hold strong.  At the end of the day you gotta sack up and do it. Theres no easy way about it. You made these choices now you gotta pay the piper. You will be better for it bro. Trust me. Youre still so young you can put this all behind you and live a happy fulfilling life with money, friendships and anything you could want. This is the single most important thing you can do for yourself right now. Literally nothing else matters until you get off the fent.

I couldnt take a proper shit, wasting hours driving and waiting for dboy, bailing on friends to not be sick etc. Its hell man. It will be a year May 16 which is wild.

"Glad youre ok! Just a tip, and Ive found it especially helpful with fent/subs: basically start by microdosing subs. Ill wait until Im feeling fairly shitty (sweaty/clammy, restless, but NOT to the point where RLS is severe and cold sweats/nausea/diarrhea are completely unbearable), but not completely in withdrawal (usually about 24-36ish hours, sometimes less depending on how much Ive done and how long Ive been doing it  the higher the quantity:longer the time, the longer Ill wait). Then Ill take about 0.5mg sub, works best for me with the strips because theyre super duper easy to cut into correct sizes/dosages. After that initial 0.5mg sub, Ill wait about 30min to an hour or so to make sure I dont catch PWD, then Ill induce another 0.5mg, wait ANOTHER 30 min to an hour, and keep going up 0.5mg like that, slowly, until Im straight and no longer in any kind of withdrawals..  So, 2 benefits of using this method: 1.) You dont have to wait until youre in agonizing withdrawal before you can get well, at which point you STILL run the risk of PWD, and; B.) IF you do happen to dose that 0.5mg a little bit too soon, youre not going to go into super crazy PWD, it will be extremely mild and youll likely only feel just a little bit worse than you did before, you wont be in the throes of all out war inside your body.. So you mitigate/ very heavily reduce the effects of PWD, at which point you know to stop inducing subs  TRUST ME, DOSING 0.5mg A LITTLE BIT TOO SOON IS A FUCKING WALK IN THE PARK AND ANY/ALL ILL EFFECTS WILL BE SO MINISCULE THAT ITS NOT GONNA FUCK YOU UP, ITS JUST ENOUGH TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO WAIT A BIT LONGER IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE INDUCING A WHOLE FUCKIN 8mg STRIP/PILL/WHATEVER LOL ",2022-03-19T18:31:16+00:00,"fent, subs, subs, sub, sub, subs","sweaty, clammy, restless, RLS, cold sweats, nausea, diarrhea"

After only a few hours I wasn't feeling right. Within half a day I was feeling sick. I didn't even give it a whole 24 hrs before I loaded 24mg worth of subs between 3 shots thinking that it would help somehow some way. I wonder if suboxone would have been better for me in that specific situation because of the nalaxone..I only had tex. Anyways, long story short, I put myself in the worst precipitated withdrawl of my life. After I don't know how many hours..maybe 12 or more plus a little rest from physical and mental exhaustion due to the PW...the subs took over and I felt normal again.

"I could not get the Bernese method to work with the fentanyl analogues out there today. They aren't pharmaceutical grade fentanyl and they have extremely long half lifes. I could get up to 4mg and anything higher and I was just using more fentanyl to combat the precipitates withdrawal. If I were you I would try to get up to 4 mg and slowly reduce your dose. If you feel like you are getting precipitated withdrawal, then you should should go as long as you can without fent (48 hours) then take whatever dose of subs you were at (or maybe slightly higher) all at once, then use fent to get out of withdrawal. Wait as long as you can. Take subs, use fent to get out. Rinse and repeat. Bernese works best for short acting opiates. You can also try a modified version of Bernese closer to what I describe above. Stop using dope for as long as you can. Take a medium dose of subs, if precipitation occurs, use fent to get out. Again wait as long as you can take a larger dose, the. Use fent until you can't. Eventually you should not get PW. And you will feel the fent working less. Alternatively, if you can get real heroin or Dilaudid or oxy, use that for a week instead, then do a proper induction. It's possible the fent in your are is closer to pharmacy fent with a short half life and you won't have these issues. The only way I could get above 4mg was to take a 72 hr break before full induction. When there is a bit of subs in your system it's a bit easier to go 72-96 hrs without a fent dose. Consider yourself 'inducted' when the Suboxone doesn't make you feel worse. It's not gonna make you feel better unless you wait like 5 full days. If it's not making you feel worse then just suck it up and keep taking it ever 12-24 he's and after a week you will start to feel better.

I used to get real bad RLS too but the last time I quit doing fentanyl (IV 0.5g/day) it was basically non existent.  About 90% certain it's because I had been taking Magnesium Glycinate twice a day for a while trying to reduce tolerance development. It's thought that extreme magnesium deficiency actually causes RLS so that's likely to be a factor as it's very difficult to get enough from food alone and the oxide/citrate forms have very low bioavailability. ,2022-04-19T15:19:05+00:00,"fentanyl, Magnesium Glycinate, magnesium","RLS, RLS"

"I'm sorry you are ill. You should absolutely not do a bump of fentanyl. You should try to get some Suboxone to continue to a slow comfortable taper. If subs aren't available you can use kratom to continue a slower taper. If you are in a lot of mental anguish consider a maintenance dose of Suboxone. I recently posted about my thoughts and tips about Suboxone for maintenance. It gets a bad rap and is often cited at being more difficult to get off than the original opiate. I believe there are a lot of misconceptions about getting off of Suboxone. If you are going to use Suboxone for maintenance, I recommend the following:  Taper down to 4mg as soon as possible and stay on 4 for the duration of maintenance. Doctors will often push a higher dose than necessary and push for longer than necessary. A high dose is fine at first but anything over 16 mg is too much. Don't jump at anything less than 0.5 mg and ideally jump at 0.125 mg (or less). Finish the taper by dosing every second day. Taper slowly. Ideally cut your dose by 25% every week. E.g. 8mg to 6 mg to 4.5 mg to 3.8 mg. Its best to use the strips to achieve accurate dosing or a scale if you only have tablets. Suboxone calculators are easy to find. If you are tapering and in withdrawal, take a small amount until you don't feel withdrawal.  I think these horror stories come from the fact that doctors prescribe way too high of a dose and push people to take it for longer because it's profitable. Also, since 2mg is the lowest dose, people jump at 2. Taking subs is a godsend for me. I was able to get back to life and not have mental health issues (which I've struggled with). Suboxone isn't mentally addicting. You aren't tempted to take more than your dose and lowering your dose is quite easy. When your life is going smoothly, tapering is easy. One dose a day means no highs and lows. I haven't fully tapered off Suboxone except going from fent to Suboxone to sober over a few weeks (and that wasn't fun) and I relapsed right away. I've read many accounts of people's Suboxone taper being painless. And I think paws can be minimized with a slow taper. You are in very the worst. Just try and hang on it will get better every day.

"The fentanyl out on the streets these days is pretty unforgiving in terms of withdrawal. Unfortunately, this drug sticks around in your fat cells for a long time after your last dose. This results in a protracted withdrawal period that can get pretty tough at times, depending on how much and how often you used.  What you're trying to do is going to be tough. Each day, you're going to feel like shit but the subsequent day, you'll wish you felt as good as the day before. And honestly, you probably will not be very functional by day 6, acute fentanyl withdrawal symptoms are pretty severe through day 7 in my experience, from there you're still not very comfortable though with moderate symptoms for another 7-10 days. You'll go through mild symptoms while you move into post-acute withdrawal and deal with symptoms associated with that (tiredness, mind-fog, depression).  I'm laying all this out there to illustrate something: What you're doing is a battle many fight and few win. You're suffering from a serious disease right now, and while it may be possible for you to separate from it without medical intervention, doing so will be the hardest thing you'll have ever done. Your mind and body will beg you for relief. The disease will bargain with you, saying ""you NEED this or you can't go to class, how about you just use enough to stay well?""  Most of us fail at that point. We make the bargain, not realizing the disease had its fingers crossed the whole time and we're going to be right back to abusing it within a day, if not an hour.  This shit is controlling  your life because the part of your mind responsible for rational thinking is being overriden by a part that thinks this substance is necessary for you to literally survive.  This probably isn't what you want to hear, but the best shot you have right now is to get real, professional medical help. The stakes are quite literally life and death. So don't listen when your disease says you can't afford to fail a class. Passing all of your classes or even just attending them won't matter if you're dead in a year, which is where this road leads. You either die, go to jail, or go to rehab.  Fentanyl is a game of Russian Roulette. The pills you are taking have no quality control, and it only takes one ""hot spot"" in a pill to knock you down for good. One bad mix can result in you snorting up a 100mg of fentanyl...and that'll be all she wrote.  This drug has killed a lot of my friends. So many that I've literally shifted my life around to join the fight against it.  The best thing you can do right now, in this moment, is recognize that you're no longer in control.

"I was actually given 12mgs twice a day to kick fentanyl. I was doing an absurd amount of fentanyl... I was able to smoke any where from 10 to 15 of those damn fake mbox 30s that are everywhere, and barely nod... I would even drive after that.  Anyway, I lied to my rehab when I ended up going. I smoked at like 3pm or 4pm on a Wednesday. Got to rehab that same night at 8:30pm and told them the last time I smoked was 7am.. they let me take suboxone at 7am Thursday, and I was 100% ok. Everyone is different, but even back when I just did heroin, I would buy suboxones on the street just incase I couldn't get my h. I never waited more than 24 hours.

"this is kinda long but Im bored and wanted to weigh in on this because I just had a convo about this on Facebook the other day.. I just wanna start with saying, THIS COMMENT ^ I 100% agree. it doesnt mean you just put up with ANYTHING? but theres plenty* of ways around kicking an ADDICT (someone who already wants to give up and die) out of your SAFE home where they can be WATCHED, into god knows what out on the streets.. a lot of these people on reddit and facebook be posting about their loved ones addictions and how badly its ruining THEIR lives & dont really ever consider how ruined the actual addict is.. a LOT of these folks really be showing they dont TRULY love their loved ones tbh .. because I know NO MATTER WHAT? Id never be able to just toss my REAL LOVED ONES out on the street and be able to go about my life like everythings okay.  honestly? coming from addiction myself? ESPECIALLY knowing theyre an addict would EXTRA make me not be able to kick them out. because I know just how easy it is to kick them out and never fucking see them again, in todays world of drugs & how fentanyl is in everything and now chemicals that dont even belong in humans???  that tough love shit? (in TODAYS world) doesnt fucking work and people (esp older folks) dont seem to get that. tough love has killed more of my friends & loved ones, than the ones with family/partners who choose actual love/support/research/understanding..  these drugs are so STRONG and mixed with so many chemicals, your brain is FUCKED.. youll just make your loved one MORE unmotivated. throwing someone out (when talking about fentanyl and horse tranquilizers and god knows what other awful chemicals that do not belong in humans) IS NOT going to make them be like omg I gotta fix my life  NO! maybe with reg H eventually, but not with this shit today! your brain is so fried and fucked up youre GOING to think well fuck this! I just want to die, Im homeless now! Im ruined! I might as well just keep on living like this until I die, Im a worthless junkie whose own family/loved ones gave up on and dont gaf about OR in some cases? they just commit suicide.. Ive had 3 friends kill themselves because their families gave up on them and threw them out of the house & werent the type mentally to just go be fucking homeless & keep going WHEN THEY ALREADY WANTED TO DIE.. point being? with the way these drugs are now? you better be FULLY PREPARED to bury your loved one if you kick them out onto those god awful streets, because those streets? dont love them, like you claimed to.. and they are 100000x worse than you can EVER imagine ",2022-04-12T16:25:22+00:00,"fentanyl, fentanyl, tranquilizers, H",

I used to try to wait 12 hours just to be safe but I eventually felt very confident at 6 hours because I was sick by then. I've done both suboxone and subutux, it's the same for either.

"24 hours is awesome and a great start. But I just had to say something, I hate when people say trading one addiction for another. That's simply not true for some people.

Some people can just detox and never touch anything ever again. Others need a bit more help, and I'm one of those people. But whatever it takes for you to stop getting high, do what works for you. And fuck what anyonr else has to say. Whether it's methadone, suboxone, kratom, vivitrol, or doing absolutely nothing. Ones not better than the other.

"If you can, please be honest with your doctor. I was like you OP and I got hooked on pills when I was very young. I had brain surgery at 15 and was put into pain management. I ended up addicted for over 13 years. When my dad killed himself, I didn't have the emotional maturity or coping skills to handle it, so I ended up on fentanyl because I lost my health insurance.  A big issue with prescribing younger people pain medication and putting them on it, is that your body becomes even more reliant to the drugs than most people. You're going through most of your growing while dependent on something that makes you feel good. We don't learn how to properly handle stress, or pain, or sadness, or depression. Or anything. Hell, I would even pop a pain pill when I was happy because I learned it could make me feel 'even more happy'. Upset? I'd take a pain pill. Stressed out and nervous? Pain pill. Angry and pissed off? You guessed it. It took me until almost thirty to break the curse and come to terms with the fact that I had literally ZERO coping skills. I didn't understand that people are not meant to be happy or euphoric 24/7. The biggest thing to tackle was mental illness and physical pain I was making with opiates. And once I did that, everything else fell into place.  These changes are the kind that have to happen with every fiber of your being. You can't just do some mental health treatment. You have to be all in, or you're going to relapse when things get hard. My biggest advice to you is to look into support groups, many are doing online groups due to Covid but they're just as good. Be honest with your doctor and ask about options. Take care of your mental health or other health problems if you have them. Start small and be kind to yourself. It's really, REALLY fucking hard, I won't lie to you. But it's absolutely doable to get off of drugs even if you've been on them from a young age.

I am so happy for you. I have been struggling so much over these last few weeks. Trying to quit shooting fet and coke and I get a couple days and go back and try again and its just a mess.

And uk something in life happend to me and being a weak minded addict I ran to drugs instead of dealing with it like a normal person would. Now here I am getting ready to quit again. Day 1.

I walked over took 5-6 more capsules (originally had 10Ive weighed my store bought capsules and theyre about .6g..so I was about uo to 10g  at this point) and I layer down, took deep breathes and slowly calmed down. I even fell asleep for 20/30 min. That terrible feeling of restlessness never came back. Ive now been off of Kratom for since 48 hours and Im feeling okay. Some restless legs, good amount of anxiety and some fears of PAWS, but I no longer fear failing to pay my mortgage and putting my wife and 3 little girls on steet, so Id say things are good.

"Getting comfort meds is possible without prescription, as long as they aren't controlled (gabapentin, pregablin, muscle relaxers like tizanidine, clonidine, etc) through online overseas pharmacies. I won't source any but they aren't hard to find. They take awhile to get to you but can help if you plan it.  I think using subs can be good, though. If you worry about long term effects, you can do Bernese, keep the cap low (4mg or less), and end by a month at the latest with a taper back down at the tail end and it can be mostly painless.  Cold turkey is possible but that's a lot if agony to put yourself through.

"That's good, gabapentin is a huge help during withdrawals. Regarding the shrooms, I too was intimidated at first. A month ago I was on methadone maintenance and miserable. Out of desperation, I ate a full ounce of shrooms over the course of the day. I didn't trip. I just had a profound moment of clarity. The next day I stopped methadone. That was four weeks ago, and I haven't used opioids since. I've just been eating those mushrooms everyday, and occasionally using acid. I'd never used psychedelics until this cold turkey, but I'd heard of their anti-addiction properties. Even so, I am shocked at the difference they've made. I had previously tried C/T off methadone and half a dozen opiates. I never made it this far or suffered this little. If I sound like I'm pressing the issue.. well I am. I firmly believe psychs can help opioid addicts through withdrawal and PAWS. Ibogaine is famous for this, but you cannot get it in the States, so I use psilocybin and LSD. They've been like manna from heaven. You don't need to trip for the benefits. You can take it right before you go to sleep, or use Ativan. You just need to get it to your brain. It'll promote new cell growth, promote functional and structural adaptations as your brain relearns how to operate without opioids.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910400/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082376/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30102078/ ",2022-04-20T03:53:44+00:00,"gabapentin, shrooms, methadone, shrooms, methadone, opioids, mushrooms, acid, psychedelics, methadone, opiates, opioid, Ibogaine, LSD, Ativan, opioids",

The thunder and lightning.  The dark skies.  Some may call them gloomy,  Others, maybe relaxing,  Others still, might call them terrifying, But me, they fill me with hope.

I really understand that subconscious feeling/act. I used in my home closet lol. 2 years later I still get triggered by the sight and smell of my closet. Sorting through my sock drawer(where I kept my stash) really bums me out. I found an old needle cap recently that triggered me so hard... I emptied my closet and threw away any remnants of my heroin addiction that night!!!  The smell still triggers me some. I wish I had never used in my home.

"I only went to NA while I was in treatment. After that, I picked up fishing and it became my therapy literally every day.  I dont think NA is the reason for their sobriety. I think its the simple outcome of keeping your mind busy especially during that first year.  Building a new routine and staying busy is key, and for some people that includes NA and because it worked for them, theyre scared to try anything else.

That being said, I really dont like NA and I dont like the idea of a bunch of addicts coming together to talk about drugs and experiences with drugs. When I went to NA I would always leave feeling like I was white knuckling on the way out, but this is what Im supposed to be doing. Always ended in relapse for me until I found something I genuinely enjoyed doing every single day and didnt get tired of. Everyones different though.

I never had cravings, no desire to use, no relapse, no 12 steps, no meetings, no sponsor, no program, nothing. I flipped a switch one day and never looked back. I've been sober 5 years. I know a lot of people have to move away from their old environment and take away that access to drugs to be successful. My bf has continued to struggle during the last five years. We both became addicts together and got sober together. We are considering moving. Even on the occasions I found his drugs I didn't feel even an ounce of urge to do it.  I'm very career focused though. I went back finished college, started a new job in healthcare but in the same field I was already working in previously, started accumulating nice things again, fixing up the house, volunteering, shadowing surgeons, health scholar program, got involved in research in a lab, and other extracurricular activities, now I'm applying to medical school in hopes of being a surgeon. So life's been busy for me. I did take like a year off sober before I returned to everything. It was nice to just enjoy life again. BBQ, hang out with friends I had pushed aside, go to the movies again, pick new fun restaurants to try, build up my movie collection, exercise, started a low carb recipe page, travel, read lots of books for fun, just learn to love life again.

"I was on either heroin fentanyl or Suboxone for the past 17 years.

I never had cravings once I finally decided to get sober from heroin. I know weird lol. I mean during the first week of withdrawals yes but not after that.  The mind is a powerful thing. You can literally think your way into feeling withdrawals. Try distracting yourself. Get some exercise! Ashwaganda is known to help. I use it for stress/sleep. If it's truly unbearable you could try Kratom. I'm not sure if it's legal everywhere but it is where I live. You just buy it at a weed shop. It acts on the same receptors as opiates. Comes recommended for withdrawals off opiates or suboxone. You can get addicted to it of course. I've been sober 5 years but my bf has really struggled off/on. I would much rather he take a Kratom when a craving hit than give into pills or heroin.  The longer you got without the easier it gets!!

So, without that debilitating addiction...Hopefully that can provide the incentive to get clean, that is what is usually so difficult when you are trying to get clean, your life is already a fucking mess. While yours is a mess it isn't completely fucked...yet. I am sure that when you were getting off heroin your life didn't look like this. Opiates in general present this problem, they are functional, in the beginning. Then you can't function without them. Then the term function takes on a whole new meaning which is that you basically are just struggling to keep your head above water but you are convinced that you need to keep using because you can't even get out of bed unless there is an opiate there to incentivize doing that. But all the while you are slowly drowning. Then the idea of success changes to just not being sick or having enough to last a few days.  It's a pretty fucked up cycle. Thank you for posting this because I had a bit of a problem with kratom too. It was after having been clean for a few years. It seems innocent enough.

"So when I first got clean, I had a lot of preconceive notions about medication. I had never used medication correctly. Ever. I had always abused it. I had no concept or experience with using medication properly. I had an idea that medication was inherently bad, it was just a drug and if I could get off heroin then why the fuck would I pick up another crutch. It took a lot of years of sobriety to realize that medications and actually drugs themselves, werent inherently bad - it was my personal relationship with them that was wrong and twisted. Since then, I have been on and off different psychological medications and I am so proud and so much better for it. In the beginning, I was honest with myself and I didnt trust myself to not abuse anything, not even fucking Wellbutrin. So I would pick it up every morning from the pharmacy. It was really exhausting and annoying but it was some thing I knew I needed to do. Then, a year and three months later when I had worked through my depression with a therapist, group therapy, still going to AA etc., i weened off of it, without ever having abused it.  That was a big change in my perception. Then it came to things like Suboxone, I wanted to judge people but I had to take a step back and realize that it wasnt those people, and they could be using it just like prescribed, but it was my personal relationship with it in the past, that experience that was allowing me to judge these people. It was a joke. I knew nothing of people on Suboxone, only that I had abused it and sold it and done stupid shit, so so must everyone else, right? No. There are people out there taking a milligram a day and weaning off, there are people out there taking 16 mg a day and eight years sober.

"Read how ppl who were addicts back in the early 1900s ..or whenever it was.. the year that the FDA yanked everything addicting off the shelves that until then, you could just.. buy right over the counter.  Patent medicines with heroin, cocaine hydrochloride, laudanum, paragoric, etc etc. They had a hell of a hard time coming off these things. Especially in big cities, and there were as many women as men who were addicts. Entire families were torn apart bc ppl simply couldnt cope when forced to do without these drugs. The same way the oxy crisis destroyed families recently for years, this did too way back when!  Also, with the coming of WW1, (1914) that too, created many soldiers from good decent middle-class backgrounds with no drug experience or history of addiction ..until they were in the war. They came home shell shocked and addicted to morphine.  Im sure theres much more that contributed to this, its far more than can be described in a few paragraphs.. and Im too lazy to look up what years all of these drug laws changed but... yes... opiates have been jerked away from the public on a huge scale before.

No relapse, no program, no 12 steps, no counseling, and no cravings(after the first week). Withdrawals were hell but sobriety for me has been a walk in the park. No ""bad days"" and no desire to use.

"If your problem is alcoholism. While a heroin addict might relate to the sense of powerlessness and unmanageability in an AA meeting and appreciate the experience of experienced members on how to live sober, an alcoholic with no experience with heroin could easily give some deadly suggestions to a heroin addict and vise versa.  For example: A recovering heroin attack with might tell a newcomer that withdrawals suck but they wont kill you  except if the newcomer is an alcoholic there is a significant chance that withdrawal could be life-threatening if theyve progressed beyond a certain point.  Another example: An AA old timer says in an AA meeting, I know if I pick up another drink, Ill pick back up to the hell  I left. A newcomer addict hears this and assumes after 30/60/90 days clean, if they relapse, theyll need the same quantity to get high. Except, with alcoholism, the tolerance drop does not return to pre-addictive levels; in opioids there is a temporary tolerance drop after 30/60/90 days clean  which kills many addicts coming out of treatment.  There are many other examples on both sides.  What AA has that NA doesnt is the attitude that they dont have all the answers for everybody . If AA as a whole (not the asshole control freak you met at a meeting) thought AA was all anybody needed for anything, they wouldnt so freely allow others to use the Twelve Steps/Traditions/Concepts for their own purpose.

"Don't do it! Something I always find ""comical"" is when addicts try to talk down there habit. Oh I'm using pills not heroin it could be worse. Oh I'm using only 1-2 pills a day, I could be using 15 or 30 a day, it's not that bad. I used to be so much worse.  I'm an ex heroin addict here. Started on hydros, then oxys, then Roxies(blue oxys that you can smoke), then heroin. I've been sober 5 years but my bf has struggled off/on and I have heard this talking down addiction argument a lot in the past. Addiction is addiction whether it's 1 pill a day or half gram a heroin. Whether it's couple times a week or everyday. We try to talk ourselves into thinking things aren't as bad to make our actions okay. It's okay because I do pills because a doctor prescribes the same kind, it's not like I'm doing heroin. It's okay to do them once in a while because I'm not in severe withdrawal. The reality is we are just trying to justify the addiction. A confirmation bias. Every time you use it's like starting the clock over. It makes the chance of you using again that much more likely.  Increasing cravings and discomfort. Use your day off to go do something fun, do something productive, get some natural endorphins going, find another way to have fun that's not drugs.  It's likely you would have minor withdrawal the next day. It takes a long time for your brain to rewire, way longer than 10 days. It's less about the withdrawal though and more about slowly going back down the wrong path. Hopefully you stayed strong! Good luck!

"I dunno where youre located but I went into a detox for my heroin addiction- its a little over a week (8 or 9 days I cant remember) and they start you on methadone/suboxone and taper you off of it by the time you get discharged. You have the option to commit to an outpatient program and if you do theyll keep you on methadone/suboxone so you can transition to the program after discharge. Ive tried getting off at home and its never worked for me, as much as it felt like being in jail I found comfort in the routine and having nurses and doctors around. I had two abscesses on my wrists from shooting up and they took care of that for me, you have to advocate for yourself if you want help (some folks are in there just so they can have a place to sleep, get fed, and not get dope sick) but its the only thing thats worked for me. Trying to do it on my own was rough cuz I was already losing my mind with the anxiety and was in no position to handle getting off of drugs in the comforts of my own home. By the third day I couldnt deal with the no sleep, anxiety, body aches/RLS/physical symptoms that my brain would go into survival/impulse mode and I would go back to using. Inpatient detox I had no choice but to be there- you can sign yourself out and many folks did but at that point I just wanted to stick it out cuz I knew if I left it would be back to the same nonsense.  I feel for you, its a tough position to be in cuz you wanna get off but the anticipation and build up is HEAVY. If you got the willpower to do it at home then by all means go for it but you yourself know you the best, I wish you all the luck  ",2022-03-14T23:28:10+00:00,"heroin, methadone, suboxone, methadone, suboxone","anxiety, sleep, anxiety, body aches, RLS, physical symptoms"

"I can only tell you how it is for me. There are two instances that I have lied: 1) As a reflex, when being confronted with someone accusing me of something, to get out of the situation. 2) To ""protect"" family/friends, when I think it would be better for them to believe I was clean when I actually was not. There are situations where I considered it would be better for them to question their own mental health (them believing they are being too paranoid, when they were actually right) and believe that I was clean, than to know the truth (=knowing that I was using heroin and having no hope for an easy way out at that moment). The first situation was very rare. The second also. But I did hide my relapse from a lot of people. I've been accused of lying a lot of times when I was actually calling the truth. For example, when I was not using for a few days and hence in withdrawal. Because the family member or friend doesn't have a lot of knowledge about opiate addiction, they accused me of using when noticing the withdrawal symptoms (empty stare, being shakey, runny nose, teary eyes). Being accused of things like using/lying so many times, when I was actually telling the whole truth and when I was actually in a very vulnerable state, made me angry and very cynical; it made me less interested in having a good integrity and actually telling the truth. After this the first situation (lying as a reflex) became more common too, because I just didn't value the truth so much anymore because I was so bitter about other things that went wrong in that relationship.

"Hey dude, 2 years clean of heroin. You are absolutely correct in not feeling euphoria anymore after using for awhile. You keep increasing and increasing the dose, but it's never good enough.  I'm so glad you recognize you need to quit. There is never a successful or enjoyable life on daily opioids. Every time you use you just wait for your next high, which only makes you feel ""normal.""  For your recovery process: I couldn't have made it without suboxone, but that's my experience. You may not want to substitute one opioid for another, and if you can reach sobriety without, that's amazing. Don't be afraid to ever talk to an addiction counselor, they are mostly a tremendous resource, and if you have a bad one, change to another.  1 You must control your depression first! I did not, and I was hit with all those suppressed emotions I was self medicating. I relapsed, but got my depression under control and succeeded. That's my personal mistake I want to share. If you used for depression then you've got to fix that! 2 You recognize you have a problem which is a triumph in itself. Don't be hesitant at all to reach out to professionals who want to help you achieve sobriety. I can't say if I'd recommend cold turkey or not based on my own experience. But I can offer you what beneficial techniques I uses to overcome my cravings and stay sober while using suboxone. Dm me if you want to talk more, I'm always available.

"I been clean off pills and heroin for going on 4 years, your family can help but its something you have to deep down want at the end of the day or youre most likely going to relapse. I got fed up and absolutely sick of it, and sick of my addiction giving people a reason to talk down to me. I mainly channeled my anger into a motivation for keeping clean, I was prescribed oxys and diladud for a work injury about 9 months ago. I took them only if I absolutely had to due to massive pain and once my arm recovered I never relapsed. Now I did have a bad problem with alcohol after getting clean for almost a year. But, you have to want it. I have money, new stuff. Im happier, and I can look people in the face and talk shit right back to them, and I think thats the most addicting part.

"You got this ! Im 8 months clean after a 13 year run with heroin and oxys and fent. For me, suboxone still got me high, still blocked me from feeling emotions, and I still sought out addictive behaviors( snorting suboxone, taking more than needed, buying on the street, withdrawing if I had none). Also it is directly supporting the pharmaceutical industry who profit immensely off addicts.  Vivitrol, is for relapse prevention once you are already clean for 2 weeks, its a monthly IM shot in your butt, and the active ingredient is call Naltrexone(read about it and consult addiction professionals). It binds to your opioid receptors acting as a antagonist, so when you decide to use opiates/alcohol/kratom, you will not get the associated high and you can get ill and very sick. So for me, I know I dont want to use anything but marijuana, and if I get the smart idea I want to use opiates, I know I cant. Its a deterrent and a effective meAsure in staying clean.

Hes just moved to a new home which Im funding. He is desperate to get off heroin (we dont have fentanyl here), but I feel hes in a more dangerous situation than when it was just that because hes now making stupid decisions while off his head.  Hes tried subs but they made him really angry and depressed. He has done kratom before but ended up taking more and more until he looped back on to heroin. He wont try methadone because he thinks that will be too hard to get off but reading on here it sounds like plenty of people do have a positive outcome and get their lives back.   He cant do ibogaine because his livers not great although because of that he cant tolerate alcohol which is a good thing.

"I'm so proud of you for recognizing you need to get clean. I'm 2 years clean of heroin and I did out patient suboxone therapy to achieve that.  Your clonazepam(benzo) is the only drug I'm worried for you, because benzos are so addictive to alot of people. I couldn't get a benzo rx when I begged my addiction and primary care doctors, even though i hadent slept in 3 days because because they said it would be a new addiction I'd form to cope. But you probably have an established rx so just be careful you don't rely on it. Definitely the hardest part was nighttime/sleeping. I could make it through the day by staying fully occupied, and I took a sliver of a subxone just to sleep. Never enough to feel euphoria(as much as suboxone can...). During daylight I forced myself to be busy and ignore my withdrawals.  It's a tough experience, but it's literally counting down the  clock until your brain receptors heal. I didn't cold turkey like you are planning since I used suboxone, it took me about a year. But I think it's 2 weeks without any opioids? To get through acute withdrawal.  You can do it. You've got a good plan in preparation. Don't hesitate to reach out to a doctor/addiction professional, it's their job to know. Avoid your triggers, stay busy, and do whatever it takes to make it. Without abusing benzos or another addictive substance. If you used to self medicate depression, you must control your depression first. Easier said than done, I know that lol.   Much love.

"Addict for over 15 years, started with pills, then graduated to heroin. I started taking suboxone to get off the dope and then started using Kratom to get off the subs I couldnt get off the Kratom, that was pure hell because its so easily available everywhere you go I bounced from suboxone to Kratom for over a year trying to kick the Kratom habit and just be SOBER.  I finally found vivitrol, I talked to my dr and let them know I was struggling. They are there to help you and if theres any judgement walk right out the door and find a new dr or search online there are drs everywhere that help with recovery.  I was able to stay clean for 5 days from Kratom and for 8 days from suboxone and went in and got a vivitrol shot. I had three shots total and didnt feel the need to go back for the 4th one. I hit 100 days sober yesterday, longest Ive been sober since my daughter was born in 2013, and Im never looking back! God bless and good luck to you, if you need anything reach out. I kept myself busy doing whatever I could, reading the Bible, hiking, driving and just listening to music, showering even when I didnt feel like it just keep it MOVING.  (To stay clean for those 5-8 days I used L-tyrosine, rhodelea rhosea, magnesium, high doses of vitamin c, and vitamin B complex) EDIT: I would DEF look into Kratom in your area I know its hard to get off but you need to get off that fent slowly transition into using some Kratom, and then hop off that when youre ready.

I'm clean of heroin/subs about 5 years. I've taken pain meds here and there for medical things but didn't stay on them bc of withdrawal  except this last time. I got a script for 3 months bc I had back to back things and I'm a week out. Didn't sleep for a couple days but I'm good now. The physical part for me off long term sub use was about a week only bc I couldn't sleep but they gave me Seroquel and clonidine so it helped loads. The mental was another week but by the time I was leaving rehab at 30 days I felt like a million bucks. And the place was awful. Ppl died there. A tech sexually assaulted me and gave me drugs. But I came out clean. Felt real fucking good. B4 the heroin and subs I was on pain med for bout 20 yrs which is why it led to those. Your milage may vary but when it's over it's over.

I have a question.... do you not have a withdrawal directly after your tip or how does that work and also how do I get it or where do I go to do this. I desperately want to get off heroin . Ive only been able to get clean a couple times and that was due to being locked up. I had a year clean a couple years back while on drug court. They paid for me to be on vivitrol and it helped so much. l was a productive member of society for once.If vivitrol wasn't  i$1500 a month I would go that route in a heart beat. I would really like to not have to be dependent on anything anymore. I'm sick and tired of this drug and all the B's that comes with it.   Anywho  id appreciate any input from anyone here on ways to combat the severe depression or melancholy after detox. The physical withdrawal is rough but the emotional or mental part gets me every time. I sob and just feel everything once I hit like 26 hour mark and feel so empty and guilt ridden ya know?

"I definitely didnt get clean and in recovery to be unhappy/miserable. For me, drugs were a symptom of a deeper issue.  Using, thinking, and feeling. I eliminated the using part by getting clean, but I was still left with two-thirds of my disease (the thinking and feeling part). I needed a solution for that part. I heal and grow so much through working an active program of recovery. Its what works for me (learning acceptance, making peace with my past, healing resentments, making the unconscious conscious, forgiving myself, amends, unlearning fear and accepting love, new ways of thinking, perceiving, new practices, unbecoming things I became, self-love, self-acceptance, self-compassion, being of service, spirituality, etc.). Best part, too, is were not alone and we dont have to do it alone.    Early recovery isnt easy for some simply because the brain needs time to heal. Whenever I suffered from lingering w/ds, PAWS, boredom, or sad/funny feelings.I reminded myself that I was simply healing and it was part of the process. I am reaching states of inner peace, Serenity, and joy at levels I never thought possible.  Its been an inward journey. Just quitting the drugs wasnt gonna get me far. Cuz I was still left with me. But healing and recovery is absolutely possible! Your brain is an amazing thing, you did not permanently do damage. I had the same thoughts as you when I started the journey. Give yourself a chance. Become curious about the clean version of you (which will take time). All the drug use damaged the imagination part of my brain (temporarily) and I lost hope. But- the truth is I simply didnt know what life could/would be like without the drugs- because I never gave it time. I want things NOW. Lol. But by fast-tracking, I would deny myself all the treasures I find along the way. (Its the heros journey after all) I was the biggest skeptic, too when it came to working steps. Im so grateful I stuck it out long enough to awaken! The bigger the doubt, the bigger the awakening!!! What you are seeking is seeking you.  I started feeling true relief and joy when I got into my 6th and 7th step. I used oxycodone in high doses on/off for over 10 years. I needed help.  If youre addiction was related to a legit prescription and not self-medicating - you may just need time for your brain to go back to the normal dopamine-pleasure base-line threshold  (and not an overhaul like I needed, lol.)

This is exactly what my friend is going through she was on hydrocodone from her doctor her whole pregnancy the doctors assured her there should be no issue at the hospital but because she was also smoking weed they told her to get her medical card in case the hospital wanted to make it a big deal which they ended up doing CPS showed up at the hospital interviewed her there showed up at her house unannounced 2 weeks later did a walk-through and then requested a p sample from the child which she obliged. They first told her in the hospital when they visited her that they are going to do an investigation and the case is open for 60 days after that it should close. 60 days came in September 2021 she never heard anything from CPS. She was scared to reach out because it's CPS she didn't want to rock the boat even though she wasn't doing anything wrong she was just scared this even happened to her. She contacted her social worker after 60 days and asked if her case was closed or how she would know it's closed and her caseworker told her the state was trying to make them mandate the vaccine so she was dealing with that technically her case should have been closed 60 days but she hadn't had the time to write an official close statement but she would let her know if she had to come back and inspect. That was the last thing she heard from her caseworker she never got any letters saying the case was closed no phone call and it's been almost a year since the baby's been born she still on the hydrocodone prescribed by her doctor but she's still scared because of the way they treated her in the hospital they made her seem like a drug addict because her baby went through withdrawals. She's just scared to call and see if the case is actually done or if it's going to restart the investigation. ,2022-03-26T20:38:03+00:00,"hydrocodone, weed, vaccine, hydrocodone",

"I was dependent on hydros which turned into oxys which turned into whatever for 12 years with a year break in the last quarter of that as being sober to navigate and pay my way through a bankruptcy. For the past year I finally gave kratom a try with the intended purpose to be to ween me through the hardest part of physical withdrawals til I could retake my sobriety.  Using kratom as a temporary means to ease my physical withdrawal symptoms unfortunately got stretched out to a necessary crutch between fixes when money was down or when I couldnt find anything. So basicallyit found its way into my usual suspects batting order of things needed to function.  I jumped off everything three days ago, and coincidentally tested positive for the flu. I figured if I was gonna be miserable, may as well stack withdrawals on the docket! Anywaysits day 3 cold Turkey for me and I feel much better and broke my flu. The first 48 hours of kratom withdrawal mixed in with opioid withdrawal mixed in with the flu was pretty terrible, and in the past year when I had no kratom AND no opioids, the impending withdrawal felt twice as bad as before kratom was in the picture.  TLDR: I recommend it for a quick fix to aid in easing withdrawals, but its not something you want to commit yourself to long term, so go into it with your head on a swivel and plenty of self-control (whichfrom personal experience, is tough.

"Well I took the iboga root whereas ibogaine is stronger and isolated from the root.  It was very productive and interesting. The body high was very mild and whereas psilocybin can be a rough body load and somewhat unpredictable iboga seemed to have an ""agenda"" in a good way. It was like psychedelic therapy. It was like watching a movie about my life showing me repressed memories and fundamental moments in my life. I went into it with a very specific intention to resolve some deep seated issues and it really took some weight off my mind. It was a very deep and spiritual experience  I'd one day like to have an actual ibogaine session but they're very expensive. ",2022-03-02T18:55:16+00:00,"iboga root, ibogaine, ibogaine",
Many years ago I took iboga root and a small dose of psilocybin with the intent to combat opiate and poly-drug addiction. I sat a awake all night watching the scenes in my life that lead to my addiction play before me. It was incredibly transformational.  I didn't stay entirely clean afterwards but for a solid 8 months I had what I can only describe as control over my addictive tendencies. I used drugs sparingly and with a sense of purpose rather than just getting fucked up for its own sake. It had a very positive effect on me and I'd like to try it again. ,2022-03-02T01:52:27+00:00,"iboga root, opiate",

"People so often forget that the detox is really just the door to get into recovery. The real changes are the work that we need to do to learn about ourselves and  fix the problems in our lives and learn how to go about life without that external crutch. Even if ibogaine works wonders for the detox, thats over within a few days anyway. Being sober depends on changes in life and thought, not just abstaining from drugs. How many people do you know that went through the first 3 days of withdrawal, and feeling a little better and then relapse? I did that probably 50 times, because the only thing i had changed was to not do drugs for a couple days.  Even if it gets you through detox, detox isnt the important part of recovery, its just the start. I bet alot of people spend huge money for this stuff, expecting to be magically cured. Recovery is a mental game that has much less to do with the drugs themselves than people want to think. ",2022-03-16T15:54:10+00:00,ibogaine,

"I went to a medically staffed ibogaine clinic in Mexico. I had 3 full treatments in 10 days. I felt so good that I thought I was glowing. When I returned home, I went right back to work the next day. I felt good. After a month or two some of my co-workers would come up to me and ask ""are you working out?"" ""do you have a girlfriend now?"" and ""what's changed with you?"" I told some of them about the Ibogaine but no one understands it when they hear it. My experience was cool, it didn't seem like a hard trip to me at all. No visions, just mental perception (minds eye). In my 2nd treatment I felt a warm ball of energy at the base of my spine and it slowly went up my spinal cord and into my brain repairing things (it felt like the cells were coming alive again). My 2nd treatment was the best, it's like it gave me a serotonin dump (like xtc). I was smiling from ear to ear, and I told the provider ""I'm doing this again!""

"this is true but in my experience actually being one of the ones treating people with ibogaine, i would say the changes someone makes in their life before and after the treatment matter as much as the treatment itself. integration of a psychedelic treatment into a life that has limits to what can be changed will usually end up as a failure. someone has to be open to change everything and anything they learn while on the medicine. if they resist, the same triggers are still there. therapy can only help so much if someone doesn't make the changes - the point of ibogaine is because it IS the thearpy. it is gonna tell you how to fix your life in one way or another - people just don't make changes and want to throw more fixes at their life. Therapy group and community that revolve around psychedelic integration are really what is needed to figure out this tricky process in conjunction to ibogaine, but like u/wearythroway said the detox part is only the beginning and when people aren't properly prepped they go in thinking that is the only challenge and then fail when they come home.  we are programmed to treat things like this since birth in our society. take a pill, fix a problem. the problem isn't one thing though- it's everything!!!!

But 12 hours after the ibogaine wore off I got all the symptoms of regular withdrawal. I don't believe ibogaine takes away withdrawal. I believe if done properly, it can distract you from physical withdrawal and help with your mental state. This BS about it fixing and healing opiate receptors is a load of shit.

Yah man it's a seriously good option.  Would you be interested in watching a documentary about ibogaine treatment ? That guy Garryth or Garret is interviewed at one point in the documentary.  the  place in BC also uses a really good method a lot different than many of the places  they tirade slow dosing of ibogaine alongside oral morphine and they build up the ibogaine slowly while dropping the morphine and they go slow which is why it takes 2 weeks. other places will flood dose you with ibogaine and won't taper you off opiates (which is still a very successful approach) but the slow titration alongside tapering seems to have better outcomes. I'm seriously wanting to go to this place. I'm unable to fly domestically right now because there's a domestic travel van in Canada for Canadian citizens that are unvaccinated.  It's bullshit. And I don't drive unfortunately so driving across the country isn't an option.  if they cancel the domestic travel ban I'm probably gonna sign up and go.

"Omg , yes. Some people cross a line to addiction and others , like myself too , suffering from OCD , anxiety  and sadness were consuming . I  thought I found the holy grail - the cure all! I got chills when you explained your withdrawal, same thing happened to me I didnt know what  was coming or what hit me . I wasnt so lucky to know something was really wrong with it and it was a time of pills for everything. My mom  has her own relationship with the pills and I had to learn not to take that personally and to be careful because she really didnt want to see me uncomfortable I feel its  because she cant deal with her own discomfort and because her own justification ( about all I can assume about her addiction/ habit / needs  , plus its older than I am )  it was hard to stop because it was available. It felt  impossible to share what was really going on for me with her because  I didnt want to hurt her and j also didnt want her to ever get in trouble . Then I learned I had enough on my own plate - as do you . I  also didnt want to risk not being able to have it if I  wanted it  ( oh its devious) It was viscous . Its a blessing that you understand what happened and dont want that . As you know it isnt a cure,  it destroys us kindly enough  not to mind . Do not be tempted nothing good will come of it  ( its really bad out there and trust me you will end up out there; this is not just my experience its happened to millions , particularly those that no one could imagine ) Being tempted is one thing , addiction however isnt about will power or logic . So you could use a support system . I would check out NA meetings online . I preferred AA myself ( but its been a while and NA has to be just as  savvy about recovery too these days ) the point is no one it supposed to compare their past ( some share appropriately as it applies to them in certain settings  ) its about how its going , where were going  and how we meet each day with that little demon whispering its sweet seduction ( my take anyway ) . I just joined ITA ( its newer its about tech addiction. I had forgotten how nice it is to hear real people having similar struggles  . Now that there are online meetings we can  just listen and not even turn in out camera , which is new and decent for sure ,especially if your checking it out . Also ime rehabs and  such arent what they used to be but these programs have history . There is also a newer ( but still have some time ) one called rational recovery which I am not as familiar with.

I literally had that same problem. I detoxed for soooo long and kept fucking up fucking up. I would keep myself entertained with shows and movies and shit for days at a time. Shit months at a time. But then there finally came a point where I had seen literally everything. And then had to just rely on new shit to come out. Thats when it got Really bad for me. If I could keep my entertained on a tv series that I could binge for 2 straight days I could get by. Id be going 3-4-5 days and then breaking down and using because I just couldnt handle how I felt physically anymore. And the thought of having to force down some kinds food one more time. Blaaaa.  Anyways. Once all that ran out and I was having to rewatch shit or wait on new shit Id notice that I would only now be going I mean sometimes not even a day. A lot of times at that stage I wound wake up and immediately freak the fuck out about not only feeling trashed all day but what the fuck am I gonna do all day to keep my mind semi off of it. Fucking shit was really bad. And you cant do anything else or go anywhere feeling like that. So your literally trapped in your brain feeling like you want to eat a bullet.  Luckily I had a tax return coming in that I knew was gonna be almost 2k. So I made a decision at that point before j even got it. Before I got it i said I was going to get a new Tv and a ps5. Mind you at that point with watching things it was even worse for me because Im a drug addict. I have no TV. No internet. No nothing. Some would sit on my fucking iPhone all day watching everything. Thats what my life was. I would sit on the couch all day long not wanting to move anymore Than I had to watching a fucking phone. So I knew to get the ps5 I would need a tv. Internet. A headset. A Ps subscription. A few games. But figured 2k should do it. Im not gonna spend any of it on drugs and Im gonna do this.  Best decision Ive ever made in my life. I got a steal on a 120Hrtz oled LG with the game response mode. 55 inch for 850. And the ps5 being its been out for 2 years in my area you literally still cannot get the damn things in the store anywhere. Its insane. So I ended up finding one off a scalper brand new disc version for 675. Which whatever. Beyond that got AT&T fiber optic internet which was brand new to my area. Ive never had anything like it. Best internet Ive ever used by far. I got a few games but mainly just play call of duty warzone now. And I mean dont get me wrong. There were a few days I was so fucked off I couldnt even play the game ya know but again I havent had a tv for a long time. So on those days I mean even re watching things Ive seen a few times was a different experience on a 55 inch really good tv. So thats literally what it took to get me through. I still struggled and shit for sure but if you are into gaming shit at all and either have a console or pC or whatever I would highly suggest playing. If not maybe trying to get a set up if you can. Its def worth it especially if its going to save your life.  Im a drug addict. Will always be. But I will say that money has no value to me because of the drugs and spending every last dollar on them. I mean fuck there were times that i was doing 3-4 grams a day of fetty. Paying 100-120 a G usually. Then sprinkle in the spoiled ass bitchy ass cunty fucking girlfriend I had at the time. Had to eat out 2 times a day. Between both of us usually smoked a 8th to a Q a day which would cost typically 40-80 dollars. .  So you add all that up every single day I mean Im spending literally 600-700. Which is mind blowing. So with that being said I lost all value of money. So for me it was absolutely nothing at all to drop 2k on all that shit. Especially when I knew my situation and how bad it had gotten in here. I knew i needed to do something asap otherwise I www r sure what was gonna happen.  So in the end I can say that it was the best thing I ever did and it really did save my life. And its really good for after detox as well because thats another really important time where your constantly needing to keep your brain busy and stimulated and not let your mind run stagnant. Thats like one of the worse thing an early recovering addict can do. So having something like that there is really important.  And also I forgot to add its more than just a game to me as well. Thats also helped me 10 fold. Back around 10 years or so ago before h for really bad and shit went down hill and never stopped. I was on the game everyday. Playing call of duty. I accumulated a lot of people in that time period that I considered my friends. I played with them every single day for 5 years straight. So with that being said when I got my ps5 I had my old user name still and all the old people. Of course only like 3-4 of them still played or had the same user names. But luckily it was the same 3-4 that I always played with every day. So it was awesome to reconnect with them after a decade and just to get on the game and have people to talk to man and people to play with and shit.  Sorry this ended up being way longer than intended but I hope it helped ya out man. Just to have examples from someone who has went through something really similar. Good lucky my guy. ,2022-04-04T09:21:45+00:00,"j, h",stimulated

I appreciate the comment. Ive never done ketamine mostly cause I could never find any. Had thought about giving it a go myself.

I am able to take what I feel and learn during infusions and integrate it into my life most of the time. Yes, infusions are expensive. If you can swing it, I suggest getting the initial six infusions over 2/3 weeks, then getting a prescription for ketamine troches which are much cheaper and for maintenance.

Kratom is NOT more addictive than bupe but it is a very poor choice for a taper for most long-term opioid users. Tapering is least painful when tapering off long-acting substances like methadone or buprenorphine (the active ingredient of suboxone, subutex, sublocade, etc.) because you only need to dose once a day and each dose overlaps. Daily doses of suboxone overlap because 24-72 hours after taking a dose, half that dose is still active in your body. This makes a taper gentler and gives the brain more time to adjust to changes.

You could argue that's because they used kratom to get off those other opiates, but to get off kratom there is nothing that can replace it that's less harmful. There's a common conception that kratom is less harmful or addictive than other opiates, and by some measures, sure it is.

I am 75 days sober from kratom and quitting was an absolute hell, and I still struggle with the occasional PAWS days, and my digestive system is still screwed from drinking so much green sludge fiber. Small daily use very easily turns into heavy use over time, because after a few months, you will start to experience mild WDs in between doses. Very very slippery slope indeed, especially for people with a history with other opioids. I'm not saying no one should use it, but I do recommend people treat it as a temporary aid to get past acutes, rather than a long term replacement.

I've only done kratom and subs seperately no where near eachother. And If the supplements are holding you just fine, then stick with those. But im pretty sure you would be a okay to take the kratom then subs if you needed to. Proud of you stranger for taking this giant leap into sobriety. It's totally worth it here on the other side.

Very quick for what? To adjust to it? Actually have a new question. I fucked up im on 15 days rn and I just went and took some kratom a couple hours ago which is actually what Im quitting. Both times Ive started trying to start the naltrexone Ive relapsed cuz I told my parents who I gave all my money to that Im taking it and can hold onto my finances now. First time I tried taking it it was too early I think cuz kratoms wd is actually pretty long and so I didnt sleep had to work so I caved. This time I dont even know. I think the naltrexone was wearing off so I started getting more energy I felt pretty good like actually full on like a normal person in that moment idk why im making this so hard Ive tried quitting for 1.5 years I never imagined after my first attempt Id ever even get this far. Like 15 days man I didnt think Id have glimpses of feeling normal again especially since I started taking it cuz I wasnt feeling normal like I did in high school happy and full of energy. Sorry I needed to vent a bit haha. Wait just realized I dont think I asked my question. Can I just take the naltrexone in 10 hours when I get up tomorrow morning? Both times Ive taken the naltrxone at night and kept me awake so im thinking maybe not rn if thats safe in terms of wd because of that.

It really has been a winding path of two steps forward, one back, for so long, and while kratom allowed me to march forward for a long time, it's only weighing me down now, it's making me regress to emotionally immaturity and making me isolate, it's bringing out all the behaviors that i hoped it would address.

I think he should just drop the kratom first. It binds to other receptors besides opioid that hell want to start recovering before dealing with the more serious opioid wd from the bupe. Besides the fact that dropping the kratom in terms of opioid will have 0 effect since its not doing anything if hes taking bupe. The subs are going to bind way harder and at 24mg will have saturated every receptor in the brain. Probably wouldnt notice dropping the kratom unless the dopaminergic or serotonergic effects cause some sort of wd.

"Usesed an lope used double Possible Withdrawal Reducing Medications Gabapentin - must have Baclofen I like muscle relaxers as you can see below... Metaxalone - muscle relaxer Methocarbamol - muscle relaxer cyclobenzaprine - muscle relaxer hard to find even though it's not scheduled phentolamine phenoxybenzamine prazosin - alpha 1 antagonist help for nightmares Trazadone - alpha 1 antagonist sleep and mybe some relief from it also being a TCA drug. Clonadine - Alpha-2 antagonist was scared of it at first but can help tremendously just watch BP Tizanidine - Alpha-2 antagonist muscle relaxer sleep aid Mirtazapine - incorrectly listed as an SNRI on my chart below apparently it is a TeCA but also a Alpha-2 antagonist antidepressant but used alot for sleep. lofexidine - Alpha-2 antagonist good luck pretty much same as Clonadine with a huge price tag attached not sure if it's even avaliable in the states yet. guanfacine - Alpha-2 antagonist haven't found source of yet. methyldopa - Alpha-2 antagonist haven't found sourse yet. Memantine - NMDA antagonist extreamly long lasting manageable dissociative. Dextromethorphan - NMDA antagonist enjoyable must have for me but doesn't last long. Ketamine - NMDA antagonist I use a legal analog for this called 2-FDCK short lasting snorting is u plesent and a waste must take oral or rectal . Not a huge fan yet snorted or oral. Admantine - NMDA antagonist have taken with other nmdas but had to tell when you taking like 20 different things. It's anti malaria and may protect against covid-19. Orphenadrine - NMDA antagonist but also muscle relaxer? Haven't found source. Dextroamphetamine - surprisingly is an NMDA antagonist and tons of people says it helps immensely but I am not much into uppers... Venlafaxine - SNRI antidepressant, not a fan of antidepressants unless occasionally for sleep. Mirtazapine - listed as an SNRI on my chart below apparently it is a TeCA but also a Alpha-2 antagonist antidepressant but used alot for sleep. Mianserin - another TeCa that I don't know much about and have no source. Atenolol /Propranolol - beta-adrenergic antagonists really only need one and there planty more to choose from. Buproprion ~ effoxor ssri antidepressants, I try to stay away from these just another adiction Imo.  Doxepine - only non addictive sleeping pill Ramelteon - sleeping pill Dicycloverine ~ gastro cramps I take before I try and eat something always helps stop the gurgle afterwards. Also help when the stabbing knife twisting pains while your blowing your guts out in the earl stages or for precepitated withdrawal.  Below drugs have medical studies behind them.  Topiramate - calcium channel blocker mefloquine - gap junction blocker carbenoxolone  diltiazem - used forget action verapamil - used forget action nimodipine - used forget action probenecid  carbamazepine - CYP3A4/CYP450 inducer (bad) will weaken other drugs Chlorzoxazone - muscle relaxer scopolamine  chlorpromazine - Thorazine great to slow stuff down a little  Vigabatrin  Valproate - used forget action Clomethiazole Reserpine  Promethazine ~ h1 antagonist just like Benadryl so useful at eary stages but can cause extrrea reastlessness and rls later in some patients including myself Hydroxyzine ~ also H1 but different class me personally found it less agitating. Benzodiazepines - be careful don't use more than a week.  Supplements (paragraphed section not originally written by me) DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA): Up to 2,000 mg, three times daily, one hour before meals. DL-phenylalanine, an amino acid, inhibits the enzyme enkephalinase, which breaks down endorphins and enkephalins at the receptor site. Please remember that if you are taking any antidepressant medication, you should consult a healthcare professional before taking phenylalanine. L-Leucine: Up to 500 mg, three times daily, one hour before meals. The amino acid leucine is required for the production of enkephalins. L-Methionine: Up to 500 mg, three times daily, one hour before meals. The amino acid methionine is required for the production of enkephalins. L-Glycine: Up to 2,000 mg with each dose of DLPA. Glycine is an amino acid that helps in relaxation, and it is essential to the synthesis of endorphins and enkephalins. L-Tyrosine: 2,000 mg, twice per day. The amino acid tyrosine is required for the production of enkephalins. Multi-Mineral Supplement: Make sure that your mineral supplement contains the following, and take enough tablets each day to roughly equal the following dosages: calcium, 1,000 mg; magnesium, 300 mg; potassium, 100 mg; iron, 20 mg; zinc, 20 mg; manganese, 6 mg; copper, 1 mg; chromium, 400 mcg; selenium, 60 mcg; molybdenum, 50 mcg. L-theanine for some safe, non habit-forming relaxation. Vitamin B-5 (now 1000mg a day) - For cortisol & the adrenals. Cortisol is strongly anti-inflammatory. B-5 will keep your cortisol in check. First time I took 1500mg of B-5 I noticed a serious drop in the intensity of my pain. Berberine: By far an incredible alkaloid! A very bitter, medicine tasting alkaloid. Can be bought at health stores. I'm no expert on Berberine but I have read around 20 studies just on this 1 compound. It's somehow related to opiates. It actually feels a bit like a really small dose of suboxone. Take it with black pepper. The berberine bridge seems to moderate morphine production in your cells, it kills pain, reduces anxiety, gives me an endorphin like energy all day long & it's natural because it's in a certain type of grape (and other things). It also reduces blood sugar & cholesterol. I love this stuff and did I say it really helps for pain? (if you react well with it which most people seem to): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526741/ Glucosamine / Chondroitin / MSM: I'm not going to say much about this. It's been overmarketed, has too much to talk about & the onset of action is slow. Agmatine is the king of opiate withdrawal treatment btw. it directly releases endorphins via the imidazoline receptor and treats opiate withdrawals in humans and lab animals alike. thanks for sharing and gl in your getting clean Curcumin So I know there are different forms and the higher end are longvida, meriva, therac..or something, and 95 something.

"The megadosing of loperamide is extremely dangerous friend! Really only need maybe an extra tablet past what is recommended!

You might wanna get more loperamide However be careful with it, don't take it for more than 5 days in a row because you can end up physically addicted to that as well.

If you take the loperamide only take the dosage it says you should take listed on the bottle. Its long been discussed as an option to abuse loperamide to offset withdrawals but people who have done this have ended up dependent on the lope and some ended up having some pretty severe cardiac issues as a result. Just take a couple pills like the instructions say and youll be alright though. It should help the pudding out of your ass somewhat.

Honestly if you smoked a mbox at 7 oclock at night and went to bed you could take 1 8mg strip of suboxone in the morning and be fine or I always did you may take half first to make sure it doesnt make you sick. I didnt start noticing the precipitated withdrawal until h and fetty as long as those mbox 30s arent pressed and are legitimately oxycodone youll be fine and wont have to wait long at all if your ROA is foil.  If they are pressed 30s you will need to wait longer at least 48 hours id guess to start taking low doses of your subs. Not positive with the pressed 30s but I know the powder fent I have been smoking I can wait 2 even 3 days to try and take a sub and it makes me feel worse than if I didnt take it. The fent on the street whether its the analogues or whatever there doing now seems to linger like a mfer almost to the point I dont think suboxone is a very good method for stopping unless you go to a detox prior to administering. ,2022-03-12T19:19:34+00:00,"mbox, suboxone, h, mbox 30s, oxycodone, 30s, subs, 30s, fent, sub, fent, analogues, suboxone",
"It's not even the chemical element of it really. It's almost entirely the lifestyle difference. If you isolated solely the use alone and no other factors then eh. But even still. Being on mdone or sub you typically stabilize on a dose, you know what you're getting, you get it from a doctor and (majority of people I mean here) take it as prescribed without abusing it. Sure everything has their side effects for many but I'd say regulated MAT meds taken as directed are gonna have a lot less of those than fent.  but also typically people on MAT are building a lifestyle much different from one of a fent user. That's a huge one and obviously goes hand in hand with mental health. Fent is dangerous so to speak, has a short half life and has you needing to redose way more frequently. You could also die. Whereas sub or mdone is just a medication that if used as intended helps stabilize an addict and so I'd say all of those things directly impact mental health.

"Not exactly sober if smoking meth... 4 years of using won't magically be undone by 2 weeks on Suboxone and a few of those days being on meth... Dunno man, it is incredibly normal to be depressed early on when not using anymore ESPECIALLY when you've fucked everything else up in your life that you had going for you and your parents obviously still don't trust you because it has literally just been 2 weeks and, I mean, they don't trust you for good reason, right? You've turned to smoking meth... Soooo not clean. Suboxone did make me feel ""weird"", I wouldn't say depressed necessarily, it was more of an anxiety / stimulated kinda feeling I did not like. Methadone serves me way better, but methadone takes way more commitment, going to the clinic daily, than Suboxone does, going to the doctor once a month and then pharmacy, so I dunno... You could switch to methadone, especially if you were a really heavy user of fent, then Suboxone probably just isn't even enough opioid for you and you need a relatively high dose of methadone which is literally impossible for Suboxone to equal out to. Good luck to you, this is a long ass journey, can't undo 4 years of damage to your brain, body, and reward system with two weeks on a long acting opioid, or 2 weeks completely clean, for that matter, takes months / years honestly, and even then, after 5 - 10 years clean, a few bad choices and it is back to drugs for a lot of us. Recovery is definitely a journey, a long one, that never actually ends (but does get better than you feel currently, I can promise you that much..), recovery / sobriety is not really a destination in and of itself. My first advice really would be stop doing meth, it is an awful drug that will fuck your life up worse than opioids, may not kill you as fast / suddenly as opioids especially fentanyl can, but will cause you immense pain, at least we're numb to all the pain when on opioids, very much so less the case with meth, at least, at some point you gotta come down and life will be much, much more depressing when you do come down, than it was before you picked up the meth... So, that'd be step #1... From there I'd look into methadone or a higher dose of Suboxone probably.

"This doesn't work for a ton of addicts though. That's worth noting. Harm reduction is absolutely worth practicing when using no matter the case, but ""harm reduction"" in the sense of reducing your intake of drugs your addicted to doesn't work for everyone.  A LOT of people are all or nothing with drugs. They're either using or they're not, there is no controlled use and to do so, for them, is more detrimental than just staying off it.  Getting drug use under control after its spiralled out of control is about as hard as kicking the shit, almost.  And sadly puts you at a much higher risk of relapse when shit hits the fan, speaking from personal experience.  I'm a recovering opiate/meth addict and alcoholic. I haven't drank heavily in 5 years and I get very, very bad hangovers from any amount of alcohol now. I haven't used meth in about the same amount of time and I'm on Suboxone maintenance. I smoke weed recreationally..  So I can definitely relate to where your at. Just thought I'd give another viewpoint. I'm also not condemning this approach given I generally follow it, but it's definitely far more risky that abstinence as your pushing those buttons you used to pound still and your brain occasionally goes ""Hey fuck that lite tap.. smash my shit in!""

"Winter was always a trigger for me. No idea why. Went into the gas station bathroom a few weeks ago and holy fuck did it feel weird to be in there just to take a shit. Very surreal. You know they put toilets in the drug room? Wild. Over 2 years since getting into the clinic, 2.5 months off methadone. Luckily haven't had any cravings at all, but you can never be too careful. At this point, I know what triggers I've had in the past, but you can be at some random location and get flashbacks after being there in the last week and being totally fine. The brain is weird. Best we can do is put up as many barriers against possible triggers regardless of how solid we think we are in our recovery. Best to avoid something you'd probably be fine with than get uncomfortable and anxious. I think I spent more time doing drugs in McDonalds bathrooms than I ever did, ya know, eating at McDonalds.

"Youre gonna be really sick after the methadone runs out. I would start with 30 mg and see if you can tolerate it, then keep the dose at that level for several days.  Dont bother taking a bug dose, youll run out quicker and it wont improve the situation that much. Dont panic when youre in withdrawal snd take more. Its unpleasant, but it will end .

"Go back to the doctor, up your methadone. You need to stop using or you will have a hard time stabilizing again. Alternatively, wait out the wds and you'll be stable on your normal dose again in a few days. Seek therapy. Maybe talk to your parents and see if they can help pay for appointments if needed. It's worth asking. Group therapy is usually free, so that's an option. Stop speaking to anyone that deals or uses. Habit easily trumps will early on and you need to change that. You cannot go back to using. You think you lost everything now, but this is your chance to prove you're trying to get back on the right path. Rock bottom does not actually have a bottom. ",2022-03-16T02:35:43+00:00,methadone,
"Definitely. Routine helps. Think about how addicting the routine of addiction is. We are habitual creatures. You have more time on your hands now. Use it. In the first few weeks of being off methadone, I made it a rule to shower daily. No ifs, ands, or buts. If I felt like crap, shower or change scenery immediately. Our water bill was higher but it was worth it. Hot water helps with the RLS and muscle fatigue. Gamify your life. ;) Start small. You don't need to micromanage yourself. I also play video games and had a hard time getting into them again, but if I set a goal to clean the dishes and had video games as my reward, it made a big difference. Studies also show that short checklists help build good habits and get that dopamine rush naturally.  Say you just washed the dishes. You can look at that empty sink and feel a sense of accomplishment, right? But if you have to do an hour of studying, pay bills online, work- there isn't much there that physically represents that accomplishment. Breaking tasks into manageable pieces on your checklist is a good idea as well. Instead of all of the laundry, aim for one load. 5-6 things is what is recommended, iirc but it's ok to write less. Anything more and you can start to feel overwhelmed or bummed out if you hop into bed without finishing your checklist. Next day, you start a whole new list- items from yesterday don't need to carry over. If you are consistently pushing something off, look at your list and ask yourself if you are pushing it off because you feel drained from other tasks. If something is hard for you, set smaller, easier tasks on the list with it on the next day. If crossing something out isn't satisfying, grab some paperclips and drop one into a glass when you finish a task. Some people say the sound of the paperclip dropping helps. Always set an equivalent reward. Putting a pair of socks away shouldn't grant 5 hours of video games. Your brain is still trying to figure out the natural dopamine production, so keeping yourself stimulated in a healthy way is important. It sounds crazy, but I promise it helps.

Just focus on today. Worry about tomorrow when the time comes. I didn't think I would ever think about what I would do tomorrow, next week, or years from now until I got clean.

Do you have a reliable social circle, do you have hobbies, a job you care about? Do you eat healthy, are you physically active in anyway, do you go to therapy, psychiatry etc?  You have some terrible past trauma that I'm sure add to your list of reason to use. You have to get to the root of the problem and constantly work on yourself.

Well you dont have to keep going up for weeks its up to you but they started me out at a super small dose I believe 5mg from what this sheet says but I doubt that since my DOC is 30 fetty pills a day but there increase schedule is like this  Start dose then go up to 50mg increasing the dose by 5mg every 2 days. From 50mg-100mg every 3 days by 10mg 100mg+ every 7 days special request So basicly to get to 50 mg from 25mg it will take 10 days cause 5mg every 2 days idk that seems a little slow to me cause at that point your body should be adjusted to the amount your taking right? Idk seems weird to me but thats fine I would rather not have a huge tolerance to it and be high all the time. So should I just stay completely clean even if Im sick as fuck and go with the plan even though its slow. Kinda a stupid question ig cause if I didnt stop using while on methadone then when I get to 50mg and try to stop using the fetty My body will be used to both so I guess you gotta just tough it out and let yourself get adjusted? Is this the correct way to do it they really didnt tell me shit at all they were like its okay if you relapse just let us know so we can get you on a higher dose. ,2022-03-14T23:35:06+00:00,methadone,

I didn't hop on methadone so I could never be sick and still be able to use.

Of the three attempts it took for me to finally kick the habit, my daily intake ranged from ~0.25g/day (first time in rehab), to ~1g/day (last time in rehab). Getting on Suboxone with almost no tolerance & no risk of inducing PWS (or any of the typical physical/mental reacclimatization that you normally experience after substituting a full-agonist opioid with a partial-agonist), IME, has been astonishingly more effective in contrast to my experiences from before.

"Generally the best way to get off MAT is a long slow taper. Talk to your provider about it. Usually the taper is something like 10 to 20% decreases every 1 to 2 weeks. In the beginning you can drop more, faster. Generally once you get into lower dosages (like 50% of your stable dosage), then you gotta go slower.  Whats your dosage and how long have you been taking it? I assume Its been a long time since you used, if youre ready to taper, so congrats! Edit: id probably do the methadone and the gaba one at a time. You should be able to make a plan with your provider as to which one makes sense to tackle first.

"Yeah I guess it's horses for courses but for my money is literally substituting one addiction for another - fair enough if that helps you get your life together but I think it's a stretch to call being a methadone addict 'clean'. If I didn't take heroin or anything and just became addicted to methadone - it happens - would I be 'clean'? And if so, what would I become when I stopped using methadone? As BB King almost sung, how clean can you get? Subs on the other hand are a route to quitting. You can't effectively use heroin on top of buprenorphine, not that that stops some people from trying I know. Although I wouldn't call myself clean if I was addicted to subs either, the point is you can use subs for an effective taper from active heroin addiction to being completely and unarguably clean in five-seven days, although not if fent is involved, granted. I'm not knocking your efforts and I get the point of MAT or whatever it's called in the US - you don't have to hustle to score any more, you can stop hanging out with bums and junkies and regulate what you use and resume something like normal life. Brilliant, you're no longer a social problem. But you remain an addict. All of the symptoms and side effects of addiction remain, you've just eliminated the criminal, anti-social element of it. Because that's what society prioritises - it doesn't prioritise resolving your problem, it prioritises resolving the problems you make for other people by pursuing the junkie lifestyle. Methadone addresses a societal need for junkies not to be out there on the hustle, committing crime or leaving needles around or trapping bandos or bandoing traps and generally making their neighbourhoods a shitty place to be. It doesn't address your actual need to become substance-free. Sure you can live your life on methadone and it's no doubt better than it was for you and everyone who knows you, congratulations and I ain't knocking it. But how about everything opiates take away from you, the wall they build around your emotions, suppressing your libido, putting your life into limbo and handcuffing you to the same place at the same time every day? Those are the things that being an addict does to you, and if you can't be free of those shackles then I don't think you can really claim to be 'clean'. Just my two cents buddy.

"Maybe change the language you use then - calling yourself clean when you're using methadone is naturally gonna rile people up who have got off heroin, been through recovery, got off methadone and subs and then GOT CLEAN. You're talking as if that last part of the struggle - getting off methadone or subs - doesn't matter, doesn't count for anything, when actually for many people it's the hardest part of the whole deal. So yeah, sitting there while you're still using methadone going 'oh I'm clean, I'm clean' when there are people going through hell to get themselves off that very substance is not going to go down well with some folk.

But I also didn't abuse it in the least because I wanted to be totally clean of opioids. I refused the RX my first week until I came begging for it after the withdrawals set in.  If you are choosing a recovery drug you need to have the mindset of using as little as possible, to get off as soon as possible. Is my recommendation. I took just enough to stave off withdrawal. Maybe a sliver of a strip every couple of days for the last few months(<1mg).  Just meet with a recovery doctor/aprn and they can help you decide what is best. The worst thing you can do for your recovery is feel euphoria from a recovery drug. That's just creating a new addiction.  Much love, hope you make it through!

"Two things im thinking of. 1, go up on your dosage if you need to. Especially if youre trying to stop using on top of it. But its important that you do that, because youll drive your tolerance sky high and then need so much methadone. 2, we really gotta lean into the learning and growing parts of recovery. Most clinics have counselors and groups and stuff, put your full effort into it.  Figure out what it is about yourself or your life thats intolerable, and that you use in order to deal with, and work on making that better. The physical stuff sucks no doubt, but getting sober is really a mind and learning kind of thing.

" I think a lot of people are completely misinformed and uneducated on the topic of MAT. I know before joining the methadone clinic, I was one of them. I avoided methadone like the plague because of all the negative shit everyone had to say about it. Which, come to find out, majority of it turned out to be complete bs anyways.  Oh, without a doubt.  People shit on me constantly for being so passionate about attempting to inform people the facts about this stuff, but I mean if nobody is willing to I doubt we'll ever see change. I do not speak much on methadone because it is not my medication, I have no experience with it, and I personally am uncomfortable in my own recovery with using that unless it's the last resort type thing.  I'm so glad it saves lives, but I do know my own life and I know that full agonist over your eyes are just not something that I can control myself with. I'm looking for pain management with the Suboxone, and while I know methadone would be more effective for pain I also know that I would be way more likely to do whatever mental gymnastics I had to do in order to justify misusing it in one way or another. But again, Melissa's just me.   I thought I was trading one addiction for another. I didn't realize the major difference between addiction and dependency. I thought I was going to be a ""slave to the clinic"" like everyone said. Little did I know, I'd be only going once a month to pickup my takehomes after a while. Just like I was going to the pharmacy to pick up any other monthly script.  This!. I mean, even for those who can say that it's a trade-off and some way shape or form... Armored action is a fucking thing. If I had the trade at miserable type of psycho going from all of the things about my old ways that ruined my life, instead traded for medication that is entirely different and no it's a lifestyle that aligns with recovery.. even if a trade-off, I would take it. I hate when people call it trading one addiction for another tho. Banging dope is an addiction. Snoring pills is an addiction. Suboxone as prescribed and not miss used as far from an addiction. Dependency sure but addiction is different. Honestly I think a lot of the people who see it that way are speaking from a place where they are in that addiction and not ready to break it. Because outside of addiction which is already so stigmatized and even more so within our community, I have never otherwise heard of anybody on medication of any type refer to it as that.  Lastly, if someone sees it that way then it's hard to believe that even if they pursued the switch, it seems they would turn what is a medication into an addiction by misusing it   I've noticed to that a lot of addicts in active addiction, don't want to stop getting high. And they use the excuse of not wanting to be on subs or methadone, because they say it's ""basically the same as doing dope."" When it's not. They just don't want to quit, so they use that as an excuse.  Oh man I hate that argument. Elicit controlled substances that are not being used for medical purposes from a doctor is so so different than making the switch to a medication prescribed in your own name by your own doctor for whatever medical purpose is given period.  It blows my mind that people's still to this day tell me that being on Suboxone legitimately for pain management (not knocking those for MAT needs btw) is apparently me and denial about my addiction which I am not, LOL LMAO. Not active addiction anymore, but still. Last night someone told me that I am just a junkie and denial and that people just lie about pain to get meds. LMAO. Yes totally I lie and my lie is so stupid that I make it for sub because I guess that's what people like me do. Excuses. It's mind-blowing how many internet strangers Beret strangers for how they manage their health, and proceed to laugh when you write back a response that is a paragraph wrong so they won't read it yet they clearly have no knowledge of you at all and still managed to know that  I'm just footwear excuses to find meds slowly to function but layman turn around and write paragraphs braiding the fuck out of people which is funny because I don't recall them being my doctor and I certainly give zero shits about that I'm solicited opinion anyway. This industry o so fucked.   I think a lot of the misinformed people preach like they know what they're talking about. Then others hear that, and believe whatever they're saying. Then they spread it to someone else and it goes on and on and on. I wish people would just do their own research or give MAT a chance themselves. So they can see its not what everyone makes it out to be. Both suboxone and methadone are complete lifesavers for people struggling with opiate addictions.

"I went into methadone treatment two years ago and have been off it for almost three months. Tapering is so incredibly crucial to my success. After years of putting artificial dopamine into my brain, it just figured ""hey looks like you're getting enough dopamine, I can hold off on making it."" Hence why the anhedonia and paws can be so extreme. I call methadone ""sobriety on training wheels."" The first six months, I was still trying to get out of the habit of wake up, hit the plug up, get high, go to sleep. Second I got stable, I began to think about other things when I first woke up. What time is it? How are my friends doing? Where's my coffee? Habits are hard to break and being surrounded by people that actively use or sell drugs or are even not doing too hot in their sobriety is not a good idea at all.

If 40mg is holding you, then great, but if it's not find a dose that does.   If it's 65 or 80 or 105 everybody is different and will metabolize methadone differently and the idea is to get you stable so you can address the underlying issue of your addiction.  Also in my experience during a taper going from 100mg down to 40mg is not the hard part, so other then adding a little more time it's not a struggle as there is little to no physical discomfort.  The tougher part can be when you get under 25-20 in my opinion. Lastly this program is about making positive change in your life, and I've seen so many people who have felt and been pressured by other to race through the program not make it out the other side.  If you have to stay on for a year or 2 or 5 or 20, if your life is better and your life is happier but you still need the methadone, who cares?

starting methadone after 10+ years of opiate usage,2022-03-27T01:04:21+00:00,"methadone, opiate",
"3 months off methadone, myself. If you're thinking about it, go. Trust me. I waited way too long and wish I bit the bullet earlier. Call your local clinic and ask what their intake hours are. You'll need to go through intake. They may say you need to be x hours off of whatever opiate you're on, but you don't need to feel like absolute death. They say to wait a long time to avoid the possibility of OD after you get your first dose. I timed my last use so I was just starting to feel withdrawals when I entered the clinic. Intake time varies from clinic to clinic, but I was able to schedule an appointment. Walked in, got called into the intake office, gave a history of my past use (what other drugs I had taken, how long I was using, what I was using, etc.). After that, I met my counselor and we had to fill out more paperwork. You do not need to go super in depth when speaking to them. Honestly, I regret explaining my whole situation because the first counselor put me on the highest risk level as if I was about to jump off a cliff at any moment. Just be polite, answer briefly. Maybe ask if you can dose and then finish up the paperwork so you can focus without being sick. They started me on 30mg which is pretty standard from what I've read over the years. Mine allowed us to come back for a second dose within a specific time frame after my first dose for the first week. That way, instead of 5mg increased daily, you could go up 10mg daily. They'll explain their process to you. After that first week, you could continue going up 5mg a day. The dosing nurse would ask how long my dose was holding me and ask if I would like to increase or stop. You'll want a solid 26 hours without symptoms to give you some time to get to the clinic late. They'll explain everything you'll need to know. I stabilized at 45 and then increased to 55mg, stayed two years, and decreased over 6 months. Easiest wd process I've ever had since my taper was slow and steady. I was initially turned off by methadone because of how long the withdrawals were said to last, but my withdrawals were a week of extremely minor physical symptoms, another week of mostly mental symptoms, and the only stuff that stuck around was the foot sweat and diarrhea. I felt fine at 1.5-2 months and it just gets better from there. I was also worried about being stuck on methadone. Sure, people can end up on it for life, but once I recognized how bad my life was when using, I realized that methadone would offer me the stability I needed to get my life back. At that point, I was sold. My advice is to try your best to avoid using while at the clinic. I stopped using on my third day if I remember correctly. That happens a lot when you aren't on a stable dose. The problem comes when people continue to use alongside their dose and just never stop. Opiates are opiates. Using methadone and doing more opiates on top of it will make it really difficult to stabilize. It's unfortunately how a lot of people find themselves at 100mg+. Takes 3 days for methadone to fully leave your system, so every dose stacks. Day one, you'd have just one dose. Day two, you have your morning dose and what is remaining from your day one dose. Day three... you get the picture. It has a longer half life which is very helpful. That's really all I've got regarding advice, but I'm open to answering any questions you've got. You can also hit up /r/methadone for methadone specific questions. Very nice community. I also made daily posts with my experience getting off methadone, so feel free to check those out as well.

"i am a fan of a unorthodox taper with methadone dosing for two weeks but skipping days after the 4-5th day bc of the way it loads and its half-life. super low sub 15mg doses and cutting to like 5mg very very fast. like prior to starting the day skipping shit.  couple that with 1-2k mg gabapentin as the restlessness starts and get off that as its action becomes less notiable (gaba loads quick with diminishing results after a few weeks) then if you have someone responsible to dish you out kolonipin twice a day for about a month as needed you can almost escape the grips of opiate addiction without much discomfort.  the real answer though, is there will always be discomfort, and your brain will need to heal itself over the course of months after your actually sober and no input to your receptors. you must change what you do day to day, find new hobbies, and not travel the same circles - until you understand that all those things must take place and are very difficult for a human being to just ""change"" - you will struggle with remaining clean. most doctors dont want to help you, or rather dont understand how - and just feed you the program they get from their pharma reps, which is literally replacement therapy - not detox. if all else fails, move your living location far enough away you cant get back and if you can get to a place like that with someone you can be honest with and will float you while you get better, that may be ideal. godspeed OP - its doable.

I guess i have alot of good positive associations here too, and maybe that has helped the associations of using fade for me?

I definitely had some relapses, it was super hard, but i didnt alot more often than i did. I tried to keep in mind that as much as we are a unit as a couple and as parents, we're also separate people. So i tried to self assess and think like im okay, im not necessarily feeling whatever bad thing caused her to decide to use....just because she felt so bad as to need to use doesnt mean that i felt that way too and automatically also have to use. That said, omg am i glad we arnt in that kind of situation anymore. It was very tiring. I guess ive just tried to stay busy. I put more effort into my work than when i was using, i do a better job cooking and feeding our family. During the not winter, i go mountain biking before work everyday. I did that stuff when i was using, too though. Maybe im better engaged and present now? I guess that associations of using in a certain place are just another kind of intrusive thought, right? So we can try to identify it as such, accept it and let it pass. And having positive things to occupy your time and your mind are so helpful. I hadnt noticed who you were when i initially replied. Thanks so much for your post, its been really interesting to think about for me personally. Ive just kind of been thinking outloud about my own recovery, so i hope its a little relavant at least worth your time to read haha ",2022-04-07T03:18:57+00:00,"methadone, sub, sub",
"Ive been in outpatient treatment with my wife. Never done inpatient so idk about that. The challange for me was to kind of balance myself and us. I mean we are a unit in alot of ways, as a couple and as parents. But we are also individuals, and we can do different things and have differnet feelings. I had to get to a place where i didnt have to use just because she did. She ended up using semi regularly after i wasnt because it took a while for her to get stabilized on methadone after sub didnt work, whereas sub was effective for me. So i was knowing that she was using and there was dope in the house. It was hard, and i relapsed multiple times during that time. But alot of times i didnt use. I think someone else pointed out as well, that a big factor is committment to sobriety. I was able to deal with my wife using when i wasnt, because i knew she was trying her best and was doing everything she could to not use. I know she hated it too, because she knew it was harder for me when she was using, and didnt want to be doing that to me either. Alot of relationships between people with substance addictions also have codependency issues. You both may need some separate space to be able to work on those kinds of things. You may not feel able to share how you really feel, if your SO is right there. But youll also need to work on your problems together as well.  Best wishes to you both!

"Exactly! I made the mistake of thinking that something awful would happen that would change my mindset but it never happened. Part of the reason I shill methadone and suboxone so damn hard is because it's almost like sobriety on training wheels. Kind of like ""here's what things would be like without sickness and cravings"" before immediately jumping into sobriety head first. Highly recommend it to anyone that can't seem to stay sober. It gave me time to save money, focus on work and get into therapy. Built up healthy habits- not only just cleaning and stuff, but having two years away from the habit of picking up and being around people that use and sold was a huge help. A proper taper makes the world of a difference for PAWS and for how strong the withdrawals are. The slow taper helps your brain kick back into gear with natural dopamine production. I really think a big reason that rehab has such a low success rate is because even with a great rehab program that provides daily therapy, once you get out, you still need to face all the real world problems you walked in with. It's really easy to get overwhelmed and relapse when you're so fresh into sobriety. No way I would've stayed clean with a 60-90 day program, even if I had every comfort med available.

He was born a nice healthy 7lbs 9oz with no other problems. He's been advanced for his age milestone wise everytime he's been tested. You would never know he had NAS when he was born. As far as your past, that's exactly what it is. It's not who you are anymore. If anything every dr, nurse, counselor, everyone I came in contact with praised me up and down for doing a complete turn around. When I didnt deserve all of the compliments and support they were giving me. Like you I was also homeless in the past, they had that in my chart from before. They even had a hard time getting my IV in when it was time for my csection (I destroyed my veins permanently). And I was completely mortified. But they kept telling me to stop apologizing, and that it was their fault (when it clearly wasn't. They just wanted me to feel better lol). I kept getting told the amount of clean time I had was amazing, and I should be really proud of myself. Everyone either treated me like I was any other mom there, or they were extra nice to me when they didn't have to be. Being on MAT, we're doing what's best for ourselves and our children. So that's not a bad thing. And we're in recovery instead of active addiction. So there's nothing to be ashamed of. Keep up the good work.

I dont regret getting on methadone for even a second. For me MAT allowed me to get my head in the right place before thinking about trying to get off. One thing at a time. I was up to 155mg and have tapered down to 31mg rather painlessly. I tried to taper off the pills on my own, but I would always end up making excuses and taking them.. sure its not the funnest going to the clinic everyday, but I was going to my dealer multiple times a day anyway.. and once you have been clean you start earning privileges which allows you to start taking home medicine so you dont have to go everyday. MAT changed my life. So many people say its awful to get off of, but I find that a lot of those people jump off cold turkey and dont actually taper down slowly and I have read dozens of success stories of people successfully tapering off methadone.. its not a quick fix though and the most successful stories come from people who work the program properly and dont try to rush things. Best decision I ever made. If youve tried stopping on your own several times and just cant seem to ever fully quit, maybe MAT is something worth looking into.

I definitely know some people who will wait for their subs to wear off to use, then get back on. But even that is preferrable to regular DOC use, given the risks involved.  I do think the purist culture both in the recovery community and by those outside it needs to stop. You aren't less ""clean"" if you use MAT than if you go cold turkey. I think the obsession with 100% sobriety is harmful and should be a personal choice. If someone kicks fentadope but uses cannabis, fine. If you get off a ten year prescription of 200+mg oxy a day, but drink a beer a night, that's ok. As long as your life and health are stable; it isn't anyone's job to judge the morality of addiction or recovery. And insisting on doing so creates a super toxic narrative that pushes people back into active addiction.

"It may take up to 6 months to feel better and to stop sweating. The withdrawal wont be awful for the full 6 months, but you may have some symptoms throughout that time. And the mental stuff and post acute withdrawal may last longer. 15 years on methadone is a really long time. Any amount of time on subs is hard to come off of too. It took me over 2 full months to get through suboxone withdrawal and I was only on 2mg a day for a few months and I tapered way down. This stuff is really awful to withdraw from. The most painless way to do it is a very slow gradual taper along with things like drinking lots of water and trying to exercise. I know its almost impossible to move let alone exercise during withdrawal, but thats why a slow taper is easier. Im so sorry youre dealing with this.

I was wrong about the 50mg its my first dose so im guessing 20 and im okay feel kinda shitty but I usually can feel good for 12-24 hrs without methadone so Ill be fine Ill probably start feeling real shitty tmrw but if I dont Ill try and get them to keep the dose as is cause I dont wana keep going as high as I can. I feel like subs are a lot better for you and easier to get off but for me its so hard to get on them and I just need to be sober I mean Ive been fighting to get and stay on subs for over 6 months and it just dosent work I either relapse during the 5 days of waiting with withdrawls or after that when I get stable and bored and complacent so idk I feel like methadone is the best option right now and will help me get stable enough to be completely off medication or at least on suboxone ,2022-03-15T01:15:00+00:00,"methadone, subs, subs, methadone, suboxone",

I know some come with subutex as well but Ill be tapering soon. Also, having to go to the clinic daily for so long and the constant scrutiny was not for me anymore. For some, methadone is more effective but its usually people with really large habits. I would honestly try subs first and see how that works for you.

"We do indeed need to choose what form of treatment is best for ourselves, i agree. Thats why i said get help, get treatment, rather than saying you need to get on methadone or subxone.  Regardless of if you use MAT or not, the real changes in recovery are personal, cognitive, emotional, behavioral.  MAT doesnt do any of  that stuff. It can provide some stability to be able to work to make those changes, but being on MAT doesnt 'cure' addiction. But look, actively using opiates these days will kill you. The only uncertainty is how long that might take. Theres serious drawbacks to being on methadone or suboxone. Thats very true. Ive been very lucky to have essentially none. But whatever they are, given that using means death, id recommend choosing being alive with whatever drawbacks MAT brings, rather than dead.

That is pretty much the standard methadone detox for a treatment facility. When I went they started at 130 and tapered down to 5 over the course of a week. You will most definitely still feel like shit after you jump from 5. You have to pay the piper at some point. No easy way to do this. Mega doses of vitamin C help tremendously.

"Hey Will, thanks for reaching out to the community. Shocking how little it seems that different types of treatment facilities seem to operate without input from actual addicts, so I appreciate it.   What was your greatest motivator whilst in rehab to stay clean?   Never went to rehab, but I was on methadone for two years. I have been off for just about three months after tapering. The biggest motivation by far is realizing how much I missed out on and how there's still time to fix that. I missed out on spending time with my parents. They're getting now and it's hard for me to think about how many times I blew them off because I was sick and didn't want them to see me like that. I'm now able to hang out any day, any time without needing some kind of crutch. I'm present and I remember everything now. No week long blackouts in my memory.   What factors assist in keeping you clean (therapy, meetings, supplements, etc)?   Private, one on one cognitive behavioral therapy. Weekly to every two weeks. I swear by it.  Never tried going to meetings, but for supplements- vitamin C and B complex vitamins were a big deal for me. Comfort medications that aid with the RLS, sleep, sweating, and fatigue are absolutely huge for people still in physical withdrawals. If you read through these types of subs, you'll consistently see ""relapsed on day three, trying again"". Those first five days are extremely uncomfortable and our brains do not function on logic. Of course I know that once the physical symptoms are over, they're over. But the addiction is so strong that someone will be just on the cusp of the physical symptoms ending and immediately relapse because their brain is screaming ""I feel bad now, there is artificial dopamine for $x around the corner that will make this go away in an instant."" So getting on comfort meds to ease the withdrawal symptoms are a huge help. Once you start getting antsy and uncomfortable, it takes so much willpower to turn away. Can't tell you the number of ""relapsed on day 3"" posts I made here in the last decade.   Is there a harm reduction technique or item that you wished was available in rehab?   I wish every single rehab gave gift packages of nasal narcan the moment anyone left the premises. A very big issue with rehabs, especially popular ones, are that they keep you for 90 days and put you on the streets. Right around the corner are dealers making a ton of money selling to desperate people. While you can't really narcan yourself, having narcan on me has saved lives. We are at the highest risk of overdose during sobriety. With people getting shipped off to other states, it's even easier to accidentally overdose because you have no concept of how strong the drugs are in those areas. Recovery position and narcan administration should be taught to everyone. Papers with reputable resources for treatment options- local meetings, medicated treatment options (explaining the difference between methadone, suboxone and the shot that keeps cravings away), etc. that are rated by actual addicts in recovery. So many times, I would get resources printed out for me for doctors that were friendly to methadone patients just to be treated like garbage or see awful reviews. I trust the opinion of other addicts more than any clinic staff member, many of which have zero first or second hand experience with addiction in the first place. Many of us avoid seeing doctors because of the stigma. We are often treated like second class citizens for just being in maintenance programs or for having ""addict"" written in our medical history. It also keeps us from being honest about our use to medical professionals which is a big problem if we have health problems that we aren't aware are directly caused by our use. Hinders the diagnosis process if they don't know, hinders it if they do know. Easy to tell an addict their pain is caused by withdrawals and send them on their way when it could be that they pulled a muscle. Being taken seriously and not be judged is important. Resources matter.   Addicts are often viewed in dim light when it comes to rehabilitation, individuals (in my country) often have been abandoned by their families. Due to this, I thought of the concept of a package of some sort to aid in some manner towards recovery and hope, please let me know if this is very surface level. If you received a care package what would you want in it?   I put packs together for the homeless crew around my area. Fresh socks, tshirts, drawstring shorts, sweatpants, jacket, beanie (hat), gloves. Basic hygiene supplies. I usually go with the smaller travel sizes if people carry all of their supplies on their back. Backpacks are another big one. Those usually begin to rip at the top after heavy use. Even the good ones. Shoes are big. A hot, home cooked meal is always appreciated regardless of someone's situation.   Did you write or journal whilst in rehab? Could this have helped in any way?   I had written out the absolute worst of the worst that I regretted while using during my first week getting off methadone at home. Things most of us just keep in our head and wouldn't dare say out loud. Wrote it up and burned it after reading it over a few times.  Journaling is always helpful. You have to be dedicated to actually writing out how you feel though. It can feel pretty awkward at first for people that aren't used to it. Providing a short prompt for journaling would be helpful. Things you're grateful for, reasons for getting clean, etc. ",2022-04-22T17:41:31+00:00,"methadone, vitamin C, B complex vitamins, subs, narcan, narcan, narcan, narcan, methadone, suboxone, methadone, methadone","RLS, sleep, sweating, fatigue, cravings"

Jumping off from 1mg, while it sounds low, as you said, will be brutal as it's still akin to jumping off 30-40mg of morphine or 15-20mg Oxy (going off Suboxone equipotentcy charts) on your receptors.  Whereas if they can get a few more days of crash tapering with the tiny doses it might ease the transition, it will also slightly prolong the discomfort, but at a milder level than jumping off a 1mg IMO.

"This is absolutely false. The naloxone has nothing to do with it. Naloxone has an insanely low BA via SL and oral. The bupe is what causes PWD, not the naloxone. Sure, naloxone nasal spray alone will give you PWD, but has no effect in suboxone. Suboxone and subutex and essentially identical If taken SL or orally.

Yeah. I see it so much. So misinformed but people will fight to death that its the naloxone. As if somehow a drug with high affinity and low efficacy like bupe wont cause PWDs alone. ,2022-04-12T17:37:16+00:00,"naloxone, bupe",
Precipitated withdrawal is intense withdrawal induced by naloxone or by bup. The naloxone in Suboxone does not cause precipitated withdrawal the bupe does. But when administered naloxone after an overdose it sends you into it. It is a result of all of the opioids being ripped from your receptors and it is hell. ,2022-04-19T01:18:14+00:00,"naloxone, naloxone, Suboxone, bupe, naloxone, opioids",

"It does, but not in a way that's manageable and not at typical doses. In some places, you can find providers who will offer ""ultra-rapid detox"" services in which you're heavily sedated while they pump a massive dose of naloxone into your veins. This will indeed clear your receptors and you'll wake up in about 8 hours without much in the way of acute withdrawal symptoms. You'll still have post-acute symptoms like GI discomfort, diminished mental acuity, sleeplessness, depression...all of that stuff.  But again, this is done under medical supervision, and that's pretty important because if you were awake and going through this...well, not only would you want to die, you'd also be at risk for complications such as dehydration or even seizure. The doctors in this situation are managing all of this while you're out cold. You won't be able to shorten things up much on your own. If you throw yourself into PWD, you'll kick the receptors in your brain clear for a little while, but residual opioids in your system will continue to circulate for a few days, possibly even weeks if you're using something like fentanyl.  As far as the dose of ultra-rapid detox, it's typically somewhere on the order of 10x the standard dose of the drug. And it's administered through an IV, so it's going to have a higher bio-availability than if you just took a bunch of pills. I can't recommend against this strongly enough. It will put you in serious pain and potentially even result in you being  hospitalized anyhow.

Right on.   This is such a common misconception.  It is absolutely the way the pharmacology works...oral naloxone at that low of a dose does absolutely nothing.  Some physicians don't even properly understand it...I always have to comment when people say this because I hate the thought of someone popping some subutex following the advice given above (not yours) and going in to PWD hell.

This time around I've managed to stay sober for 14 months and this time around I just started feeling somewhat normal I would say within the last few days to be honest with you. During my recovery I was trying to convince myself I was feeling normal but now that I have a couple days in which I felt like my old self I've realized I haven't been feeling normal for a long time.

"29/M .. Living in New England. (North East) .. struggled with opiate addiction from age 22 to present day. Similar addiction progression as most.. Within a year I went from 1/2 pills a week. (30mg Oxycodone) to after only 12 months acquiring an embarrassing 12 pill / Day habbit. Out of my friend circle who all dabbled in these during that time I ended up being the only one that let this animal of a disease latch onto me. Up to this point in life I've dabbled with everything besides H/Fent. Any other drug I could pick up 1 day & not have it cross my mind again for 6 months or a year later. I DO.. most definitely have an addictive personality and a predisposition to Opiate abuse from my father who is also a former Heroin addict. Have a hard time accepting that I wasn't passed down this genetic predisposition to Opiates & Opiates only just like my father.  At age 24, Is when I made the jump I swore I never was going to make. Morals tend to fly out the window when the pharma connect runs dry & your puking up stomach bile, shivering on your bathroom floor. Long story short my next 4 & a half years I spent running around dancing with the devil. I commited  a large amount of unknown felonies to support my new found habbit.. When your out running like I was , I was just ICE cold emotionally. Looking back at the brazen acts commited like I was just going grocery shopping. No fear, No hesitation, No emotion. Looking back these invisible stainless steel sack I was letting hang was probably the reason I was able to do whatever I may or may not have done without getting caught or facing any consequence.  Lots of family members but distance between them & I.. not because they were scared or hated me. But because they couldn't stand to watch someone they love just completely self destructing. Same with a few of my close friends. Also torched not 1 but 2! Relationships with women who where literally Wife material.. They all left for the same reason actually now that I look back.Only thing I can say is that I have always been a relatively good human being with Morals.. sometimes these morals where better than others. I never stole from family..never let my family see me teetering on the edge of death which was becoming a regular occurrence at this point. I never laid a hand on a woman.. shit I don't think I ever even raised my voice. Which I was told was Why my addiction wasn't a victimless crime.. I was leaving behind a trail of broken hearts & emotions wherever I went.  Atleast now I can say that I am happy with the headspace that im currently in. Of course I have a list of regrets longer than a child's Xmas list. But as I've matured threw the years (slowly) I've started looking at certain aspects in life from a different point of view. A good head space is in reality the single most important thing I can try to hold onto. When I loose my positive Head space is usually when I start self destructing all over again. A couple years ago I would probably be venting about how I should be driving a nicer car or be better off financially.. but at the end of the day if I don't maintain positive thinking  & a positive outlook on things I will slowly but surely start to loose hold of whatever sobriety I've managed to earn along my way. Once I lose my sobriety.. I think I already explained how that goes everytime without fail. So this is my first 100% genuine attempt to lead a life & carry myself in a manner that would make the old me proud.. the guy I was prior to surrendering to my addiction. That's the guy I was meant to be all along... I'm just a huge fucking fan of the scenic route.. clearly.

"When I tapered off 10mg X2 daily. I did it by reducing pretty quickly until I hit 4mg X2 then I had to slow right down.  Cut the 2nd dose to 2mg then tapered it off then slowly worked the daily 4mg down to 0.01mg before jumping off and I still spent a good fortnight feeling rough Sucks the situation your in mate, especially as 4mg and under is when the taper actually gets hard as for most people, doses above 4mg induce the ceiling on the positive opiate effects. This is beneficial in a sense as it allows you to taper to 4mg surprisingly quickly, but going under that dose becomes like tapering any other opiate, quite uncomfortable.  my advice would be attempt a crash taper. Get yourself used to only dosing once a day and take as little as possible per day until you run out and then hope it's not going to be too intense and get some comfort meds if they're not going to pose a relapse risk.   Promethazine (I'm sure DPH would work too) DXM in medical dose ranges (60mg a few times a day or less) Orphenadrine and to a far lesser and more controlled extent, Benzos were the comfort meds I used when I got fully off and aside from the first 4 days, it was very bearable given I'd be on it for 5 years prior to that taper. I was back to work in a week which even I didn't expect (job is Labour based)  I can totally understand why your scared but try to look at the positive, you won't have the ball and chain stuck to your leg if you succeed. You'll get some freedom back.  Hope it goes well dude. DM if you need any advice or support. Edit: Sorry, I missed the part about benzo issues, scratch them as comfort meds as they might induce relapse.  I will also say MOST Suboxone WD horror stories come from people jumping off huge doses (which is really anything above 1mg when it comes to quitting suboxone) If you've experienced high dose methadone WDs. I assure you they're not THAT bad. About as long, but not as intense.  You were on some massive doses man. I'm surprised Suboxone worked at all, I guess that medical taper worked.  I know I got a massive habit one time where returning to suboxone simply didn't work due to my tolerance being so high (above suboxones ceiling) which is also why they tapered you down to 30mg Methadone as anything higher is above Suboxones ceiling effect and it wouldn't hold you.

"But if it were possible, would you want to value your life? Because if you would, then it is absolutely possible. You're so young; you can still become anyone you wanna be. It's a shame you're in such a hurry to find out what comes next before you've even given yourself a chance to experience what you're capable of in this one. There's no guarantee that what comes in the next life is any better at this point. Your power of choice has been hijacked. But you can take that back. People do it every day, and so can you. You can make up your mind and turn this thing around. Doesn't it make you angry that something external is controlling what you think about and what you do? It doesn't have to be that way. You can take a time out to decide whether you want to choose to use opiate or not. Right now, you've lost that power. Suboxone therapy gives you a chance to regroup and learn how to live without self medicating. I'm a lot older than you are, and I wanted nothing to do with the program when I was your age. No matter what your drug of choice is, if you live long enough, it'll stop working for you, and you will be forced by the circumstances you have created to get honest with yourself, or you will die. The ends are the SAME for ALL OF US. There is great value in getting honest with yourself on your own terms. I didn't wanna see myself as ""one of those people."" But I AM one of those people.

Things will go from bad to worse. But when we choose to fight this, then we can begin to arrest that pain, slow it down, and stop creating consequences that we will ultimately have to pay for. Life can get better, and you can go on to live a successful and productive life and minimize the damage you create. But it isn't gonna fall in your lap. You are gonna have to pursue something better.  Is it easy? No, it isn't, but it's easier by far than what you're doing right now, and that's a fact. That voice you're listening to that's telling you otherwise is lying to you. Taking your choice back is the easier option, and it's well worth it. The sooner you take action to save yourself, the better and your success will bring hope to the next person who is where you are right now.  Many people suffer with this disease, and those who are recovering will come alongside and walk this with you. There is far less shame in seeking out help than there is in giving up. You haven't failed until you GIVE UP. So, don't. This is a chance to save yourself. Take it! ",2022-03-20T17:41:36+00:00,"opiate, Suboxone",pain
Serious props to you for acknowledging that opiate addiction usually cant be beat on its own. I know it seems silly but I feel like thats a huge step in recovery. Im sorry I dont know anything about Suboxone but I still wanted to comment ,2022-03-16T22:22:53+00:00,"opiate, Suboxone",
First time I commend you for being courageous enough to share what your family is going through and reach out for help it can't be easy to be vulnerable about a personal family struggle such as this.  I myself have struggled with opiate addiction and put my daughter through hell is she's not even a teenager yet at 12 years old. It sounds like he's been doing this for a long time and so his behavior patterns in his brain are deeply conditioned to using something to fill a hole that seems to never fill. I myself have been through an intervention where my mom my dad my cousin and my brother all basically put their feet down and set boundaries and ultimatum if I refuse to change and seek help. It may be a pride thing and not wanting to admit that he needs help and he truly may not I think he needs it.  I have no experience with microdosing so I have no advice there but I do know that I have been on Suboxone methadone and Vivitrol hooked on kratom abused Delta and t h c.  Harm reduction options are different for everyone so it might be a good Avenue to research more about microdosing I know from what I do know about it some people have had amazing results with their Mental Health and the research is promising.  My advice would be 2 have some thing may be similar to an intervention but maybe different depending on your family Dynamics but his routine in life and his behavior patterns and habits need to be Shook Up drastically change of place definitely time off work to go to detox somewhere where they can medical assist him through the withdrawals and then looking at other options depending on what kind of goals are able to be set and agreed upon.   Some sort of counseling wouldn't hurt because I'm sure he suffers from shame and guilt a lot and it can really weigh heavy on a person especially an addiction that has a habit of escaping emotional pain through substance use.  Some sort of Outlet for him to discuss things he's going through but men can be prideful I know I am. I'm sending you and your family light and love peace and healing and I truly hope that your father finds his path to peace.

I suddenly had more cravings than I ever had in recovery so far and they didn't subside as fast as they normally would.

"I was an opiate addict for 7 years. At the end of my run I was doing about 2 grams of good street fentanyl a day along with 140mgs of methadone a day.

Eventually I overdosed standing up and fell on my arm and fucked it up good. A month later I odd again and went into a comatose state for like 9 days I think it was. If that wouldnt have happened I dont think Id ever would have been able to quit. I got really lucky cause the ER managed to get me into a brand new detox center and they took good care of me for those 9 days. They weened me from all those opiates down to 30mg of methadone a day in just one day it was hell. Also no rehab would accept me because around here they wont take you for being on methadone plus my arm was in a cast. There was one two hours from me that would have taken me even with the methadone but the cast fucked that up plus my insurance didnt cover it.  I was really weak from using and from just laying in a hospital bed for 9 days. I could barely move, but luckily I had a family member I could stay with. I withdrew in the fucking summer heat with no AC it was terrible. Thank god I couldnt move my body too good back then. But yeah it was hell those 24 days before suboxone.

"was an opiate addict for 6 years, the last two using fentdope exclusively around a gram a day. My withdrawals were fucking hell on earth on top of losing my 4 year relationship (ex went to rehab and found a new partner there), having to move back to my moms because of it, losing my long time job, etc etc. it got to the point where I pretty much considered myself at rock bottom unless I ended up dead. I decided to get on a suboxone program since I had used it in the past for being sick and it worked great. Luckily I found the most compassionate and understanding doctor that took me in as a patient. Honestly if it wasnt for the way she handles the intake and weekly visits and all that I probably wouldnt have been able to stay clean. Anyway, the first week on subs was a little rough mentally and I released once (which was pointless due to subs blocking all receptors) but I havent touched that shit since then. I was on 4mg twice a day starting in April. by miracle towards the end of the summer I had realized that I was only taking a single 4mg strip once every two days. I just kept forgetting to take it and had 0 withdrawal symptoms or anything. I decided to just try and cut the suboxone script out completely too before I became a slave to it for life which I was convinced was gonna happen from the start of taking it (not that its a bad thing, anything to keep a needle out of your arm is an improvement). When I finally ran out in October around day 3 of no subs I started feeling the slightest withdrawals coming on. Nothing unbearable but just shitty enough. Bought some kratom and the WDs vanished. Fast forward to now and all I take is 3/4 grams of kratom every two days which Im happy with. A year ago I was unemployed in my moms basement and unable to get out of bed without any fent. Now Im working full time for above average pay and havent touched fent since last April. Still living in my moms basement (lol) but moving into my own place next month.

"It is possible to take less and less until you can take what's left from the sickness, bit taking one hit in 24 hours that's not enough it's better when a short acting opiate is used to dose minimally twice a day using half the dose you would use if you did one hot per day. The point is to maintain an as steady as possible blood level of opiate then slowly lowering that means slowly getting sick until it's not to call sick anymore, but let me give you an example. I was in a rehab place beginning 90ties, but in those days you would just have to withdraw without meds and that I couldn't take so I took off a day later while I really liked to stay so I returned the same day this time with aspn amount of heroin with me I believe two grams. Anyway to prevent bad sickness I would smoke a few times a day as little as I needed to suppress the worst of the withdrawal and every day I took a little bit less and about a week later I am was down to a quarter gram with that I did three days in lowering amounts and when it was gone eventually the leftover sickness was a joke compared to the first time and so I managed to stay for a little while. I was a little bit too honest thinking they would appreciate the truth about how I managed to stay so I told the staff about using heroin in lowering amounts to be able to stay and I could fuck off instantly so they didn't like the truth and I felt like the dumbest idiot on the planet for wanting to be honest. This was such an idiotic Baghwan hippie related rehab with meditation and punishments in the form of having to wear a wooden plate five foot long for a week saying * I ate with my mouth open at breakfast* so for such minor things you get insane punishments back then that was now such madness is history. Anyway that was just a little about how rehabs used to be and damn they are good in brain washing people fast, because I was already brainwashed enough to think they would like the truth while in reality it was the opposite, which I would had spotted without the brainwashing first. The point is that it can be done to take a little less each day, but you need a ton of discipline in order not to take more then you absolutely need so for me in such a place I was more or less forced to be disciplined so it's more difficult when you can use more without direct consequences still it stays a possibility so of that's what you want do it. You know what works even better to finish off an opiate habit without getting sick? If you never was dependent on methadone and you quit the dope to replace with methadone for no longer then one week then behind this week the methadone covered for the withdrawal, but you won't be methadone dependent in a week while the withdrawal is as good as gone in a week.

"Yeah, you're a fucking addict. I don't know if you're a troll but let's break this down: Using for years.  Using for mental health reasons, so that means it gives you euphoria to some degree.  In AA, so already literally an addict prior to opiate use.  Trying to get validation that Using opiates for years, for a reason they aren't prescribed for, as a method to cope, is ""respponsible"" and somehow proves you aren't an addict.  You are literally a functional addict who hasn't increased their use yet (that we know of), and you are going to ready go through hell when you lose access. I guarantee your brain has already been impacted by your own. Some people don't need more than 5mg a dose to get there. The length of time has already done it.

Can you use them in a non-addictive way?  Ive been using them this way for years. Like youre absolutely addicted and you seem to be beyond the stage of denial.  You dont even realize its a problem.  You have a bigger problem which is why you dont know.  If and hopefully when the leukemia is gone they will stop writing the prescription.   Hopefully youre just a weirdo freak that will be like ah,  oh well.  So long, sweet opiates. And never have a problem.  But when youre taking them for mental health. Im pretty sure thats what 95 percent of junkies take opiates for basically.    Anyway.   All that health and perceived happiness is just synthetic and gross in the end.

"The reward system in your brain is a bit fucked right now due to opiate use. When you are supplying your brain with opiates, your dopamine (feel good) receptors downregulate, and your brain stops producing its own dopamine, in order to achieve homeostasis. When you take away the opiates, you have a serious dopamine depletion. That is why you are depressed and probably anhedonic ( unable to feel pleasure or motivation for anything) what you are experiencing is completely normal, and your brain will come back to baseline if given enough time. It just has to heal. Just keep telling yourself this is all part of the healing process, and give yourself some compassion.

I know all my life even before taking opiates I always ran hot cuz I been a big dude since I was little.. the only time that changed was when I started Working out daily...specifically cardio I know it definitely regulated my body temperate(s) out FAST.. I've been using and then got clean while actively exercising...and using and then gotten clean without exercising.  It makes a huge difference..... Now that I dont exercise...I run hot all the time.  But When I used to shower while actively running about 4 to 5 miles a day...I always had to turn the water on HOT.. and always put a heater on in the room I was in to go to sleep.. I imagine if I wouldnt of been as extreme ..I'd of probably had a regulated body temperature.  But since I was sometimes burning more calories than I was taking in some days I was always cold.

" all I wanna do is get high  Or maybe you just want to feel better.  To me, it sounds like you might be suffering from depression. If you had depression before being addicted, it isn't unlikely that depression would pop up again after quitting. At least that's how it was for me. If you feel bad now, be very careful not to make things even worse for yourself because no matter how bad things may seem now, we can always do things - like addictive substances - that will make our lives even worse. Also avoid not doing anything that you know could make you feel even a tiny bit better. This is important. Do not avoid daily exercise. Do not pass up opportunities for casual contact with remaining friends and if there are none, do not avoid finding ways to make new contacts when opportunities arise. Do not leave dishes unwashed or clothes on the floor etc. etc. Be careful about what you surround yourself with. Do not spend endless hours merely distracting yourself from your life if you can. Do not forget that addiction always leads to more pain. That is why you quit 2 years ago and it is why using opiates to feel better now is a really doomed plan. Do not forget to keep doing whatever you can to have less pain in your life if you can help it. You have to discover things you like better than making yourself sicker and weaker with addiction during this short time on earth. Take very good care of yourself.

I promise you will feel better and if not maybe it's depression or some other issues getting under your skin maybe even subconsciously.

Any drug that mimics endorphins is gonna seem like it perfectly carries you away from the pain of life but once you become dependent the fun and games are over. Physical withdrawal is hell on earth.

Its almost like we dont have free will and that gremlin takes over. However, when youre in active addiction your perception of reality really strays from what is actually going on and its pretty clear to people who know you that something is up. You cant really blame your boyfriend for not trusting you and wanting to keep your kids away from that. Im not going to berate you about the dangers of kids around opiates but if youre serious about changing and getting that monkey off your back you really need to look in the mirror and make some lifestyle changes. You can absolutely transcende this addiction, leave it in the past and live a happy healthy life.  Figure out your triggers. For me life just wasnt exciting and I was always looking to enhance my current reality. Drugs did that for me. Being stressed about obligations and all the shit I procrastinate about always triggered me. Id walk around desperately in search of something to quench that feeling of need inside me.  Im still in early recovery at about 11months sober and have work to do still but my life is improving spiritually mentally and physically. I found some hobbies like sky diving and some other adrenaline heavy activities that scratch that itch for me. I exercise nearly everyday and go to bed tired every night. My mind doesnt race as much. I write down the shit I need to take care of and force myself to do things I dont want to do so it doesnt keep piling up.  A lot of life is just maintenance and that shit is boring af and much easier to do high but once you make it a habit you stop thinking or debating when to do it and just take care of it.  Start to unwind all the knots in your head and lay it all out infront of you on paper. What you hate, what you love, what you cant live without, mistakes and successes in your life. There is often a pattern of behavior that stands out and you can work on going forward with a clear head and good intentions.  You need to be disciplined with yourself. That gremlin will come back and tell you its ok to use just this once but thats when you need to notice it and snap back to default aggressive getting shit done mode. That shit is not your friend and wont make anything better.  Include your boyfriend in this with you. He can help you clean up your house and throw anything away that might tempt you. Be honest with him and if youre about to text your guy to cop text your boyfriend first and ask for help.  If not your bf then find and cool counselor or therapist that resonates with you that you can just unload on every week or two. A lot of ex addicts are counselors and can be a great safety net.

Few things. Ive been on opiates for 17 years. Fent powder for the last 7. Ive had a fuck of a time getting off but I will say a few things. 5 years ago I did quit cold T and was good for 10 months. At that time I had been using 12 years. I was basically 100% by like month 5 or so. So anyone who says it takes years or even a year is wrong. And for you dude what did it say you been using for a year? Dude you will be good within a month pry 2 tops. Also I have the same fucked off horrible issues for my stomach. The best thing you can do which gaba helps is keep something in your stomach at all times. Trust me on that one. You have to force yourself to eat. I know how terrible it is but in the long run it will keep your stomach feeling much better than being empty with all the shit going on in there. Also bentyl helps and its easy to get. As far as the sub thats where you really gotta fucking watch it man. Theres been times where Ive went into PWD from subs around or after 72 hours. Ive also went into PWD from taking a sub at exactly 112 hours. Which was 5 days. So you really really gotta be careful dude because if you go into PWD and cannot use your gonna pry be going to the hospital. Using is the only thing that will reverse that if it happens and if your in a spot where you cant use If that does happen then your really gonna be fucked.

From ages 13 to now 36 I have lost almost every single friend that I was starting using drugs with.  Back to the point.. . . Kudos for stopping opiates.  Be careful with Methadone and Suboxone.  These are wayyyyy STRONGER than most people think. And this can be a terrible substance to add to a mix of other strong substances. Xanax, cochise and methadone.....no no no no no NO  Straight up. You very well can DIE with just a little of each of these drugs.  On top of that, the withdrawal from methadone was worse than the oxy 80s I was using that precipitated me coming to the methadone clinic. I truly had to start heroin or oxy back to GET OFF THE METHADONE. I couldn't kick on my own or with the TAPER. 3times I tried.  Also, it is really hard for your body. Beyond terrible withdrawal symptoms,  I got like 10 cavities. This is part not taking care of my teeth. But proven to damage bone. I can only wonder what those times did to my internal skeletal system.  Just be aware of what you are doing.  Best.

Itll sit in that receptor and just block any potential agonists coming in. Itd have the exact same effect as having no opiates at all. Naltrexone has zero effect on depression and anxiety. If youve cold Turkey and come this far, but are now looking at taking subs, then Id advocate for getting on naltrexone cause itll prevent the suboxone from working and you taking an opiate. But no, it wont get rid of the symptoms of PAWS. That only goes away with time.

"Do you also study behavioral pharmacology? Are you a neuroscientist? There is actual peer-reviewed scientific research showing that opiates hijack the brain & mess with your reward system. But youre especially at risk of youve experienced trauma or other mental health issues. Shame and self-hatred is also what drives people to continue using (for some people more than anything else) and letting go of those feelings is an extremely important factor that helps most people let go of substance use. It doesnt help to reduce it down to dumb choices. Substance abuse is way more complex than that, no matter how much you want to simplify it. And for plenty of people, even that initial dumb choice often involves loads complex trauma, mental health issues, and self-hatred that people absolutely cannot control, and that doesnt go away by being berated constantly about something the world already berates you for constantly. That has already been shown to not work. If youve experienced addiction and are now sober, it doesnt make you better than someone who is not where you are yet (but clearly wants to be). You can reduce your addiction down to a dumb choice if it helps, but its beyond reductive and also not at all aligned with what research actually proves. It might be scary, but we dont exist in a vacuum and our choices and the way our brains function are absolutely products of the the time period, surroundings, people, environment, culture, etc. in which we grew up, in addition to any genetic or chemical or physical mishaps that our brains might struggle with. No one likes to think their agency is limited, but we often have to admit that in order to examine & analyze it enough to even begin to overcome even a little bit of it. It takes work, but without examining not only how your experiences and traumas and culture and genetics and the people in your life have affected you, but also examining how those things have shaped your beliefs, youll walk through life as a mere neurochemical reaction, reacting to your predetermined set of biases youve collected throughout your life, thinking that all of your choices are only ever your own and youre never influenced by anything. Its ironic that by denying that were often at the mercy of chemicals & reactions in our brains, you seal your fate as someone with much less agency. Its hard fucking work that people often dont want to do, to constantly consider how our brains are working us and how our choices (and thoughts) are shaped by all sorts of biological, environmental, cultural, and historical factors,  both as children and adults  but the good news is, thats also something that our brains are capable of, and thats the place where we get our agency.

Not only have you done it once youve done it twice maybe 30 times hell maybe 365 times maybe even more.  Making the jump from fent to nothing to me is basically near damn impossible.  Youre brain is not going to like you and you would be doing the chemicals in youre brain a serious favor research how long you should stay off fent (the info is changing on here pple used to say three days now pple are saying at least 7, I never did fent so thats the only part I lack experience in you will find the right amount of time to wait before taking subs if you do some researching).  Then youre brain can get used to not being severely hacked while not going through the chaos of withdrawal.  When you can cope with life on subs and you are no longer severely being triggered or obsessively obsessively thinking about getting high you can slowly lower your dosage, and If you want to finally get off that.

Maybe a dozen or so years ago. Length of time 100% will affect the severity of the kick. I only got on subs in September in a last ditch effort to stay in school and keep my guts in check. Well, it didnt fucking work well at all. So, leave of absence and five months to get better. But anyway, my point is the less you use (time and amount) makes a huge difference. I honestly expected this to be worse. Suboxone withdrawals are so damn drawn out. I already seem to have rounded the corner. I dont even know how many days its been (fucking benzos lol). But I just ran out of benzos so I hope I can sleep. I can get some if necessary but Id rather not. God Im so starving but not hungry my gut feels like an angry cavernous pit.

"Damn, dude, Im really sorry to hear that. Its a common story. Im 32 and have been doing opiates for 20 years at this point. I made a really bad choice really young. But you got fucked by getting hurt. I hope workers comp is helping you out a lot. I had a really, well, bad and violent thing happen to me due to the lifestyle. Moved to the east coast where it was all fent and it had t reached SoCal yet. Scared the shit out of me and I actually stopped using heroin because of that. For the most part at least, I did get some afghani #3 on the DW a few times but I did get some pure fent powder a few times years ago when it was just regular fent and weaker analogs, not this shit now. I dosed it volumetrically so I could accurately dose. Never did it again.  And, in any case, fent was enough to make me stop doing dope but I didnt stop getting high. I started with poppy pods but they got harder to come by and I went down the poppy seed spiral. Did that for years, back and forth between them, subs, and methadone. So many detoxes. Since Ive moved to this state in like 7 1/2 years Ive probably been to detox over a dozen times. Anyway, Im rambling. Im taking benzos for the withdrawal. I wish you and your kids the best. Dont keep throwing your years away and fentanyl is a game of Russian roulette. I dont know if youve had a benzo problem but I never have but they help tremendously. So does clonidine if you can bpget it but dont expect to be able to work on that bullshit. Makes you feel really faint. Anyway, what is your situation now? Living with your woman and your kids currently? Are you working? And if so can you take time off? I dont know what fentalog or other super potent synth(s) you were using. Some of my friends have said that the withdrawals from some are horrendous (like carfentanil). I was told by a couple of people they had to wait up to five days to take a suboxone to not go into precipitated withdrawal. I guess my point is, how soon do you need to be functional, working, being a father and family man, and making money? Because if you are consuming one of those long acting analogs you will be sick for quite a long while. If that is the case then it likely isnt feasible for you to do right now unless you could take a medical leave from work and go into an inpatient treatment. Otherwise, well, your best bet may be to get on suboxone and try to get down to a low level <2 mg, ideally <1 mg. Suboxone is insanely overprescribed and theres no good reason to take multiple strips per day unless you want a horribly drawn out taper. If you went this route, you may have to take a few days off from work to induct on suboxone. Youll need a few days with no opiates in your system. You ,ay still feel off fir the first few days and sort of dope sick, it varies. You will probably need a higher dose initially but once youre used to it taper down low and stay low. Once you have PTO set up taper really just as far down as you can before you your time off. Then you make the jump when you have the time off. Comfort meds are always good to have on hand. But, hell, if you can get insurance to pay fir it under some sort of disability crap and you can continue getting some payment I say go that route, the other would be long and drawn out. This is the end of my wall of text. Best of luck, my dude.  DM me if you like.

"It's fun for like a month and then it goes downhill very quick. I was on opiates for 10 years, and I think fent is one of the worst opiate highs. The high lasts 4 hours tops. I'm sober now, but I do miss the days where I could get high for 6 or 7 hours with good ole H and not have to take a hit every other hour just to get high. Today's opiate game sucks.

I would say probably 4 to 7 days I would say after 11 days youll be feeling almost normal but it takes awhile to fully get used to it and also weening down getting ur body used to taking less will make the symptoms less than they would be on a higher dose then quitting Ive quit some high potency opiates like fentanyl and stuff so it might be quicker than 7 days ,2022-03-15T13:51:16+00:00,"opiates, fentanyl",
"If you've been using hard opiates like fentanyl for years, it might be really hard to stay clean from PAWS.

I used to get the worst cravings when attempting to stay clean but I could never make it last.  If you can stay clean without maintenance meds, that's great but many people like me who have been using for 10+ years, I recommend trying suboxone.

"I wouldnt put too much hope in that. People have stayed sober from opiates after a good jail detox, but its highly uncommon. Like not even 1% ( some one correct me).  The reasoning behind this is that rather than being ready and choosing to get sober, the person is forced into sobriety under extremely uncomfortable circumstances and instead of working on skill building to stay sober, theyre constantly thinking about that bag theyre gonna grab as soon as they get out.  I only say this because Ive been there. The only reason Im clean from heroin today is because I chose to be, and I decided I was done being miserable. Most people cant even recognize theyre miserable because theyre so focused on the hustle and getting well/being sick. Its a weird, sad, tiring, aging, miserable hell hole of a life in active opiate addiction. Nothing else matters but the drug, and thats not an understatement like the general public thinks it is.

"CW SEXUAL ASSAULT Morning y'all. In 10 days I'll be 35 months clean! I just got done w my therapy appt- I love my therapist so much, she's so good at her job and just generally a good person who I get along really well with. A few months ago I was supposed to start prolonged exposure therapy for my CPTSD, but life happened and it fell by the wayside.   I was discussing my (ugh I hate this word cuz its so over used but whatever) traumas surrounding men screaming at me/manhandling me, cuz yesterday I was watching this true crime show where this woman was describing being attacked by this man that was her roommate, and up until then had been relatively normal and cordial, and when she described how his eyes all of a sudden just, like, changed, I straight up started to have a small panic attack.   Seems stupid, I know, but hear me out. I've been in 4 relationships with some level of abuse, some lower and some higher, and I grew up in an abusive household, BUT. Three out of four of those exes, despite their despicable and at times unforgivable behavior, did indeed truly love the shit out of me. They were mentally ill as fuck- not an excuse for their behavior, but definitely a large factor- but at the end of the day those men did love and care for me, even if they were extremely fucking shitty about it. Same with my parents- yes, they were shitty, mean, and at times physically abusive. But they did always love me, even if the ways they showed it were often crappy.   However, one out of those four exes did NOT love me. Lets call him B.   He hated me, or had no feelings for me at all ad he saw me as an object to manipulate. This was the man that, at 9.5 years my senior, I met at 15 and was infatuated with- I had literally never had a crush on anyone that intense before- reconnected with at 17 after I had gotten out of my first (Also abusive) long term relationship and had just had a fairly traumatic abortion, and who managed to manipulate and groom me, in that weak vulnerable state, to moving across the country to rural California to be with him,  simply because he was lonely and needed a toy to play with- that is, before he threw me out (figuratively and kinda literally) of course.   He made me lie to everyone there and say my age was 19. He raped me in my sleep two times and also stuck his dick up my ass without warning. He would berate me, call me stupid, remind me of how weak and naive I was and how I had no idea of the ways of the world. (Being the age he was back then now [27] I do of course understand how frustratingly naive I was about certain things, despite being overall much more mature than most my age, but like holy shit man that's why you don't date a 17 year old when you're less than 3 years from 30 like ffs lmao).   He was also very much still in love with his ex, and would shove that shit in my face in an awful way sometimes. When I finally called him out on that he punched me in my face. Luckily that happened at his step-dads house, who loved the shit outta me (this man's family was such amazing, good people and I would've truly lost my mind out there without them- tell me how tf someone like this comes from people like that??) And his step-dad wrestled him to the ground, punched him in the face, and told him to never ever lay his hands on me and then kicked him out of the house (we were staying with them temporarily at the time).   But it was awful. It was lonely, it made me feel like shit. His dog was my best friend and I still think about that dog to this day. If it wasn't for her I might've killed myself. I was SO in love with this man, and it honestly took me falling hard for and dating R to get over him, cuz R is the only person I've ever been as infatuated with as B.   The whole time I was riding freight trains, my mind was on him. I would wonder if he'd been through this shitty rural town before, or if maybe he'd ridden on this same grainer I was on. I had done opiates fairly frequently, like maybe 10x/yr, since I was 15, but had never caught a habit and had not yet done straight up heroin until right after B broke up with me. That's the only time I've been broken up with in my life, and my heart was broken. He didn't even have the courage to actually end things- he just told me he had to go up north to trim (weed) to make money and that I couldn't go with him, so I had to go back east. Of course, we were really just breaking up, and he was a pussy. I'll always remember watching him cry, holding his dogs leash as my bus pulled away, and me sobbing so hard I could barely breathe.   After that, I felt like all that was destined for me was destitution. My fate was to ride trains and do dope. I wasn't tormented enough to be the person i wanted to be. I wanted to be tough, gritty, independent; for people to be scared of me. And I felt that i had secretly lived an easy and privileged life (monetarily privileged sure, as we were always comfortably middle class, but easy and nice and supportive LMAO no- I just didn't know back then that the way my parents treated me wasn't normal, cuz it was all I'd ever known) so therefore I had to make sure to throw myself into the pits of the underworld, so that I could be what i felt in my mind I deserved to be. Lost, worthless, useless. Dirty and strung out and dangerous. So far on the fringes of society that you're at risk of losing your humanity.   A huge reason I got strung out the first time around was B. He convinced me i wasn't enough, that I was worthless, that I deserved to be laughed at and left alone and thrown aside, and that in order to be of the caliber of the type of woman he'd actually take seriously, I had to make for myself the kind of life that he had at that time, a saga of addiction and trauma and failed relationships and traveling and partying and doing time and life falling apart, trailing behind his 27 year old self like the tail of a comet.   I did all that. I really did. Here I sit now, with EXACTLY that kind of life trailing behind me. I look exactly like my 17 year old self wished my 27 year old self would look like- dreads down to my ass, a face tattoo, a sleeve of the grim reaper, and the look on my face that I always envied the older girls for- that look of life having beat you the fuck up but you knowing you got through it and, if you have to, can and will get through it again.   And B did end up hitting me up, way in the future, talking to me in that shitty whiny crust punk voice of his, saying how beautiful I am now and how sad he is that I got strung out and how he'd still like to see me and hang out with me- yeah, so you can spout off more of those false, stupid platitudes you always said to me? He'd say things, back when we were dating, like ""you're something else, you're special, you're the most beautiful girl in the world"". He knew what my dumb broken brain wanted to hear.   I'm over him, of course. I fucking hate that man, and he's 37 now and, for the record, not nearly as wildly attractive as he used to be lol. But this man fucked my head up SO badly. Not only was he an influence on me doing dope, but he was also def a partial influence of me getting into subsequent abusive relationships.   This is so long and I don't expect anyone to read it and normally I'd just copy paste this to my notes app and not post it but if it's not over the text limit I feel like I should, because getting to the root of these things that happened to you a decade or more ago is an essential (but fucking scary) part of recovery. 3 years in and I finally feel ready to do this; to face the hell I went through head on and to try and reach out to my 17 year old self through the ether and tell her, don't worry, I'm here, you will get through this, you're amazing, you'll turn out exactly how you want to be and everything will be okay.   I'm sure im over the text limit now. Sorry for rambling and thanks for having a place where I can sort out my dumb thoughts. If anyone did read this and has had any similar experiences that may relate to their addiction and recovery, I'd love to hear it if you're comfortable sharing.

"You will notice a big change in how you look and feel, I can promise you that. It just takes time. Is this your first time coming off of opiates? Because in my experience it takes about three months for the fog to really clear and energy levels to stabilize. They say it takes 18-24 months for your brain to require itself back to normal. What doses of hydro and oxy are you currently taking? And how exactly are you planning on detoxing? You gonna try to wing it at home or go to a detox or something? I definitely would recommend you try to get ahold of some comfort medications before detoxing at home. Otherwise they just give them to you in detox. And, in my experience, using a rapid suboxone taper would minimize withdrawal. Just try not to beat yourself up too much. It wont help. Best thing is to just keep your eyes on the prize and just keep working and staying goal focused. Believe me, I think we all wish wed never gotten on this train. Ive been back and forth on and off opiates since I was a teenager and Im almost 33 so I feel pretty tired and worn out myself.

"Whatever you do, don't seek out other opiates. It's NOT easy but hydrocodone is much easier to come off from than others. I started taking Suboxone (from friends) when I couldn't get pills anymore .. I got really high off of it and addicted to it. The withdrawal was so much worse and I was only taking 2-4 mg/day. Got stuck on fent after I couldn't get Suboxone anymore, and that's 100x worse.  I know that's an extreme situation, but still my experience and I wish I would have just dealt with the hydrocodone withdrawal 3 years ago instead of spending thousands of dollars and totally throwing my life away. And I was someone that was always really against drugs, didn't even want to take the prescribed hydro and never in a million years thought I'd be snorting whatever powder I could find on the streets. But tapering is your best bet, it is so hard to do. But it is possible if you're disciplined and have a plan. Everything WILL be okay!!  Sounds like you're using for legitimate pain and not to get high. Will you be in pain without it? Hopefully when you move you can find a good doctor that will work with you and what you need.

"I've been on opiates for about 3.5 years. But the first 2.5 years it was only hydrocodone. Started about 10-20 mg a night couple times a week. Then more often,  then higher dose. I always ran out of my script with a week before I could get it filled but never got WD.  Then a year ago I learned the dark net. And started getting oxy 80s mundipharma.  Always sealed blisters in a box. (Always bought bulk) 50 at a time. Started with only doing a quarter pill (20mg) every few days, then every other , then every night. All the while my tolerance getting bigger. Last 5 months I've been at 90-110mg every single night. Got covid 2 months ago and went into WD cause I stopped dosing  (didn't know i was in wd) thought it was covid symptoms. So obviously took oxy and felt better. After recovering i tried to go a day or 2 without oxy to prove to myself i felt wd during my covid. and felt the same WD feelings.  Immediately dosed. Decided to taper with what I had left (60 or so 80s) after reading up on WD and tapering and comfort meds on here. With help from bropiates I came up with a plan and scored comfort meds.  By saying it's getting tough I mean I'm feeling the WD creep up on me mid day. I usually take twice a day. When i was at 60mg last week I was taking 20mg around 4pm  then 40 mg around 9pm. Next day I would feel fine till about noon. Then noon till 4 I'd feel super lethargic, yawning, slight cold symptoms nose running, headache, and that uneasy feeling almost like anxiety. My twin 4 year old boys get home from school around then too so that adds to it. I'd probably feel a little better if I could just lay down but who has time to that every day from noon till 4. That 4pm dose is such relief. I could probably take it a little earlier but I try to muscle through to get till at least 9pm. Last few nights I've been adding 300mg of gaba too. But I'm not gonna do that anymore. I don't wanna ruin my tolerance for my real WD coming.

"It's going to take a lot longer than that for people that had pre-existing mental or physical illness that they let go untreated and worsen.  I have pretty severe chronic pain after brain surgery and dealing with scoliosis/nerve damage, and it's the catalyst that led me to become addicted to opiates.  I eventually started using it for the mental relief that chronic pain caused (extreme anxiety, depression, etc.) and had to learn how to function all over.  A LOT of people with addiction are like this and have to build their lives all over from scratch. 4 months is nothing in the grand scheme of learning coping skills, dealing with increased pain, mental issues, etc. 4 months is barely enough time for most people to get over acute withdrawals, much less the post acute withdrawals which are more mental/emotional.  Also, let's be real. Most addicts don't decide to get clean after one year. And the few that DO, often end up relapsing if they've only had a 'yearly' opiate addiction because more often than not they haven't hit rock bottom in such a short time. And each time they relapse, it gets harder and harder to recover as mental, physical, money (and often crimes) pile up.  Obviously not all addicts are alike, but people need to face reality that this is something that is going to take YEARS of work. You're an addict for life, and it WILL come back if you don't build the proper skills to deal with your addiction.

"Youll definitely go into full blown withdrawals if you stop for more than 48 hours. It truly does sound like youre dealing with immense amounts of pain, so be kind to yourself. The reason so many people get addicted to opiates is because they work. I know it sucks being dependent on something to function, but Im sure it also sucks dealing with awful pain every day.  Im not a doctor, so certainly listen to yours instead of us, though as another poster said; long term opiate use actually lowers our pain tolerance. Addressing the roots of whats causing you pain sounds like a wise step, and one youre already on. Fitness, being at a healthy weight for you, and learning different psychological strategies to deal with pain are all good steps.  If you find you can manage pain with these other methods, then maybe pursue gradually lowering your dose and trying to live without opiates. But if they work and feel like a necessary step towards living a functioning, mostly pain free life, than Id certainly not recommend beating yourself up over using opiates as theyre intended.

"Chick here.   Then X backtracked, saying men/women shouldn't lean on each other in that manner (X advised I find a sponsor of the same gender - I wasn't looking for a sponsor/a program, I just don't have anyone in my life who understands anything related to chronic pain/opiates).  Could be seen as him recognizing how vulnerable people are early in recovery and is setting boundaries to avoid the wretched step 13. Very easy to dive into sex and relationships early on while you are still figuring shit out which opens up risk for stress and instability in your life which, in turn, can fuck with your ability to cope with newfound sobriety (nasty break ups can lead to numbing the pain, trading opiate addiction for sex addiction because your brain is screaming for dopamine). Or it could be that he knows how it looks for sponsors to get too personal with their people, knows it's wrong ethically, and doesn't want that stigma if he makes a move. Can't tell ya which.  but X does share funny/interesting stories from their past when they were in active addiction (X has been sober for years).   Be careful with this. It's one thing to laugh about the past, but there is a fine line between a funny story and glorifying the lifestyle, ya know? I've been triggered multiple times by stuff like this. If this has any potential for triggering you, set boundaries now. Better to set the boundary than end up triggered and relapsing imo. I try and stay far away from any glorification of it. All of the stories I share include the downsides of my addiction. ""I'm glad I'm not in that situation and I am happy to be sober"" stories.  X is very supportive of my hobby & encourages me to stay busy, physically active etc.   Good trait and good advice.  Conversations have become more personal (X commenting on other classmates issues, pointing out their character flaws, X speaks highly of themselves/how they're trusted by the opposite gender etc).   das a no from me, dog. If it's a passing statement, I guess it's fine. If he is consistently talking about how he isn't a threat to women, fuck no. Only people I have met that talk like that are grimey. Good people don't need to do that. Good people also don't consistently talk shit about other addicts or other people in general. ""Look how great I am and how messed up everyone else is."" At the best, it's cocky. At the worst, it's projection and narcissism.   X hasn't done anything inappropriate- they haven't made a ""move"", no physical contact that wasn't appropriate to the situation, they don't message me about personal matters since creating the opposite gender boundary...  Green light.  X is significantly older (>20 yrs older), the opposite gender & in a long-term relationship. They've stated multiple times ""you can never fully trust addicts"", speaks openly about past relationships, & shared private details of their life (as have I).   Just keep in mind that there is definitely a potential ""power imbalance"" that can form here. He has a lot of sobriety time and he's a lot older than you. This is how step 13s happen. He's right about how you can't fully trust an addict. My go to joke is ""how can you tell if an addict is lying? Their mouth is moving."" It's lighthearted but unfortunately has truth behind it. Just because he is in a long term relationship doesn't mean that would stop him from pulling any bs. He better keep his hands to himself.  I feel as though we are friends but then there's also the strange imbalance when they make it clear they see me as a younger, inexperienced person who is at a vulnerable point in life. They emphasize their significant experience with addiction/manipulation while warning me away from trusting the wrong person so early after quitting.  Ding ding ding. Good advice. Again, could be that he is warning you about others or projecting. Can't tell you which side on that one either. At least you are paying attention and looking out for these things. Still know it is easy to brush off red flags when you finally have someone that ""gets it"". It's hard cutting off connection with people that we can relate to, so it's easy to make excuses for sus behavior.  In the last 6 months I've dealt with multiple deaths in my personal life, the end of my serious long-term relationship (unrelated to the opiates) and trying to figure out how to accept my pain while adjusting to who I am without oxy... It's a lot of change to my life and who I am in a relatively short time.  You are vulnerable. Please, please be careful. If you are making a post like this, you feel like you have a reason not to trust him. Listen to your gut. You need to focus on yourself. Do not let anyone get in the way of that by introducing stress into your life. Even if he just gets overbearing and doesn't make a move- bye bye. You have your own life to figure out, your own problems to solve.  Grief is complicated and messy in and of itself. I literally had a threesome the day I lost my house. Then I got in a poly relationship after my friend died. Do I regret it? No. He was a close friend we had already slept with. Was it something I expected to do in a tragic situation like that? No, not at all. Banging after losing everything and sleeping in a hotel? Again, grief is weird.  Is X just being a good friend and looking out for me? Is the advice genuine because they don't want me to end up getting 13th stepped?   Only you can really answer this, hun. But I gave my two cents. Be vigilant. Do not excuse worrisome behavior. Rose tinted glasses and all that. We want to believe that people have our best interests in mind, but sometimes that leads to people taking advantage of us.

"Well now remember there's plenty of functional addicts who basically run on the same motto of ""I never take too much"" so don't think that alone means you haven't got an addiction. Though people who are overly semantic about it could make the argument of dependence vs addiction but with opiates, in my experience, they go hand in hand. It's the physical dependence symptoms that bring on the addictive behaviours usually. I wouldn't be so hung up on the ""am I an addict"" question or look at it as some extremely negative thing. It is what it is. What you don't want to do is delude yourself into believing your not an addict when you are as you'll never get better with that mindset. As they probably teach in AA, the first step towards recovery is admitting you have a problem. I've never done a program but that rule is absolutely true in my experience. Alternatively if you don't like thinking of yourself as an addict, due to taboo and stigma then at a minimum acknowledge your physically dependent on your medicine if that becomes the case. Accepting this stuff for what it is, is the biggest step you need to take when trying to stop, as you probably know from AA.  If I were you I'd just accept I'm taking an addictive medicine in a way that will lead to physical dependence and deal with it when you have to or want to. Just don't delude yourself into thinking that because of the circumstances you won't become dependent or possibly addicted, it just comes with taking the medication sadly.  You just need to be aware of the risks your taking.  On the same token, with your illness, it's totally understandable that you'd need something like that to take the edge off and they're also presumably reducing pain from Leukaemia, I don't mean to come off as judgemental. If you weren't sick I'd tell you to stop but given you have an Illbess where opiates are a totally valid treatment, I'm not going to say stop, I just recommend caution.

I also read how the opiates could actually cause pain and after my 2nd of 3 surgeries, I was very scared and panicked when I came to and was in horrific pain, though I was maxed out on what pain meds they could give me.  I started looking into alternatives to real pain. There are some theories that back pain is the new ulcer, and that the mind can basically combat it. Im not gonna pretend to know the specifics, its in Dr. Sarnos books. That approach didnt work for me and I was referred to a pain therapist. This was before my surgeries, when I was still undiagnosed. She didnt tell me my pain wasnt real but gave me techniques through controlling my anxiety when the pain got intense and meditative type techniques that would help me control my pain levels. It allowed me to greatly decrease my medications and I think that decrease in meds allowed me to feel the pain in a way that actually got me diagnosed after years of being told I was med seeking.  There is research that suggests pain therapy can be as effective as opiates. At first, I did both, then weaned down the meds part. I hope you find something that works for you!

"The ironic part is that when you are feeling sad/depressed/bored what you need to do is get out of the house but it is so fucking hard to do when you are in that state of mind. I have found that brushing my teeth, showering, etc. before going out and doing something (even if it is the gym) helps kind of mentally prepare myself in an ""I'm doing this"" kind of way.

"I think most ""sensible"" people start out like this.  Though I'd also point out the lack of sense in choosing not to take prescribed opiates as prescribed and then claiming sensible use.  They're great for your mental health in the beginning, most hard drugs feel like they're doing wonders for your mental health in the beginning.  Then after a while (usually a good six-twelve months) they slowly stop helping, you start thinking you need more, your mental health gets worse which again reinforces the ""take more"" Then after 2-4 years on it your a shell of your former self in regards to creativity and all that. It doesn't come without opiates to fuel it.  Basically, there is a reason they're not used as antidepressants and similar in medicine, because they only work well for it in the short term and can cause a horrible dependence that will make ALL of your issues worse than they were when they started.  Source: I basically did the same thing for years. It started amazingly then I slowly isolated myself away from everyone because all I needed in life was opiates. I quit for six months after 5 years on it and by the end of it, even with treatment, I was so depressed that I basically chose between opiates and suicide because there simply was no other way to achieve joy anymore. That's totally fucked, you don't want that.  Be careful. Don't fool yourself into thinking there's some magical way to take opiates without becoming addicted. There isn't and wondering if there is, usually, is one of the initial signs of psychological addiction, you know there is no way to take them daily without addiction and yet your still wonder if you can.  Then consider if you want to risk losing medical access to them while addicted and being forced to either go through the hell of WD or score off the streets.  Be careful friend.

"I totally get that!! and while Im not a fan of the terminology, I do acknowledge that drugs are not for me. I was addicted to opiates after being prescribed them by my doctor. Unfortunately Ive needed opiates a few times since getting sober for post-surgical pain. Ive had to totally rework my relationship to opiates, because theyre occasionally a part of my reality.  I realized it was never about the drugs, it was about the pain and fear that led me to numb. The few surgeries Ive had in sobriety, I did not finished the post-op script or accept refills. Ive been able to take the medicine as prescribed, throw the extra away and move on.  Historically, Ive developed a maladaptive coping response to pain, and still having health issues, I need to acknowledge the potential slippery slope with medication. Im not in denial about my history of addiction, but that portion of my life does not define who I am.  I think words have power and I dont like to reduce myself to labels that no longer apply.  Labels are useful in term of coping, but sometimes theyre limiting. like for example its important to be able to name anxiety and panic attacks, because otherwise you think youre dying. But sometimes having the label of anxiety disorder can limit oneself. For example, in the past Ive said oh I cant do that. I have anxiety or Im just an anxious mess.  The anxiety label in those situations prevented me from doing things and self-actualizing. Who am I? Am I an addict? Am I anxious? No, who I am, at the core is pure essence. Simply: I AM. The rest of the labels that come after I AM are just reference points for the ego to position itself in the physical world, and create an identity to differentiate myself from others.

I've given 180% effort trying to build a life with opiates but it just isn't possible, I've tried EVERYTHING. the post detox depression suxks but when the brain re balances- its really worth it, I swear. Those first couple weeks of being clean your brain will try anything to get you to use, including trying to convince you that you're majorly depressed and that it will be like that forever, don't underestimate how much of that is post withdrawal. For the first couple weeks I honestly didn't see the point of being clean, I stopped using to avoid the 25% of my life spent sick and tired, and ended up sick snd tired 100% of thr time without drugs, it goes away and irs worth it, I lost a lot of my personality to drugs and over numbing myself, it feels really good to start to see My soul return. My advice? Its obvious. If you could quit now you will probably save yourself a lot of bullshit, but I get it either way, when I was at 60-120mg of real oxy a day, there's nothing anyone could have said to get me to stop, it's just scary how quick a lack of access to real oxys turns into 4 grams of street fent a day in a blink of an eye and don't say ""I'd never"" because everyone said it. Much love and best of luck, if you're a week clean you're through the worst physical part, maybe try and give it a month and if uou dont like how the other side feels, you can always get high again!

"However the inspiration comes, it is valid. I am proud of you, and I know your wife would be too.  I'm coming up on 9 years clean. It's hard realizing that wanting opiates (for me) is not really ever going to change. All the human relationships I've had have ended in emotional pain, besides my partner and our sons. It's natural for me to want to stop that pain. My mother attempted to suicide us both when I was 11, and my life never really seemed that valuable to me since then.  I can either feel the bad emotional pain (which does manifest as somatic physical pain- yay!) right now, as the situation is happening, or I can take opiates to stop my feelings. There is no middle ground.  I can only come to this sub when I'm struggling. Then I try to encourage others on the sub that they can succeed, too.

"I really agree with your response I just think it's more helpful for people to know no one knows and it's better to keep a positive mental attitude and know even tho you feel terrible you are making positive changes in your life every second you abstain from drugs.  I have been addicted to opiates for about 15 years. I had two years clean somewhere in there.  I have times where withdrawal is terrible and other time its comparatively alright.  I know if I'm trying to quit and I didn't have the experience I have, and someone online said I'd be all better in 4 days and then wasn't I would give up.  It's the reason to take it one day at a time.  The only reason I said anything was the sub was seemingly saturated by people asking, when it's basically asking what the weather will be like 10 years from now.  I love the posts when people say what day they are on, how they are feeling, and how they got to there.  Those are helpful and inspiring.  Just getting to 24 hours is really hard for me so I think a lot of people asking about a estimated timeline don't realize they have information and can provide others with inspiration.  Withdrawal is hell, it lasts roughly a week, I just think people on here have more to offer than they realize and focusing on the length and severity is counter productive.  Let's have more posts about helping others get there, or for those that are there tell us what life is like on the other side.  I have detoxed more times than I can count there is no trick to it, you just gotta stop using.  How do I stop going back?  How do I deal with the issues that made me use in the first place?

Thanks for the comments guys. I think you are right I should quit the opiates first before I even think about weed.

I played it very safe by only using like 1 or 2 quarter pills through the 2 main nights, but could have taken more. If already prone to depression, it helps a lot to start on an anti-depressant ASAP, even while still using (but check if it's safe with opioids. Agomelatin is safe to use with many drugs, and helps with RLS and sleep, but it is one of the less effective ones.)

Also, because I'm not in MAT I get absolutely no mental health services at all. What a huge surprise that people in MAT have better mental health because all the resources are directed towards them.

I had my first opioid when I had toothache too and it was also from my mum. She used to get Co-Dydromol 30/500 which is dihydrocodeine and paracetamol. Had 2 of those and felt amazing. Now I dont feel like that even if I take 10 30mg dihydrocodeine  that was like 7 or 8 years ago now though. I would take them recreationally at weekends to make hangovers actually pleasant and didnt get physically addicted till about 2 years ago when i used them every day to help etizolam withdrawals. Im off them now for well over a month but have no intention of staying off them forever as I want to use them again like I used to. Never going to use them every day again though as its not worth the withdrawals when I run out ,2022-03-17T09:42:13+00:00,"opioid, dihydrocodeine, paracetamol, dihydrocodeine, etizolam",hangovers
"First off I want you to ask yourself a couple of questions,  ""Am I a bad person for being an opioid addict?"" ""Am I hurting anyone due to my addiction?"" ""Does my drug use bring me happiness?"" ""Is anyone effected negativily due to my addiction?"" If you use drugs because they make you more comfortable and happier and you aren't hurting anyone while doing so, then what's so wrong about it? Is it wrong because society tells you it's wrong?  Is it wrong because the ""war on drugs"" tells you it's wrong? There's a book I think you should read by a man who is a psychologist and neuroscientist, working as the Ziff Professor of Psychology at Columbia University that has recieved many recent awards for his research and is also a heroin addict. For a long time he was a closeted user and never told a soul he was an addict but that only brought shame and guilt to his life. It wasn't until he left go and came out and openly spoke about his addiction and how the only negative it was causing to his life was the negative uneducated, and inexperienced members of society made him feel because of the stigma related to drug addicts. Heroin made him happy, it made him able to deal with life much easier.

Opioids are naturally produced by the body, they are called endorphins dinorphphins and so on, and they act exactly as opioids like oxycodone, sometimes when the body get for a repeated time opioids the production of endogenous opioids decreases and addiction comes, but this is not 100% secure, many people use opioids for long time and are able to stop even without taper, I say this by experience. The main point of every therapy is to live an healthy and happy life, substitution can help this, can get your boyfriend a normal life as long as he doesn't abuse the meds, he can get a work and have a normal life, he just has to take a medication 1 a day, addiction is not a mental problem, is more a neurophsycological problem that develops in predisposed subjects and those who have cases of abuse in family (infact alcoholics mainly have cases in family).

"They didnt put you on MAT? No wonder you picked up again. Theres three general different options for MAT, when it comes to opioid recovery: methadone  Suboxone  Vivitrol.  Since youre still using, I would recommend methadone or Suboxone, tapering until you can get onto Vivitrol. The only problem with Vivitrol, is you have to be 5-7 days opioid free, in order to take it. (Its injectable naltrexone which is an opioid blocker)  MAT (Im on Vivitrol) enables me to stay sober. It clears my mind of the physical cravings and obsessions long enough to get to the emotional side of why I use.

"He is being honest and responsible. You have a good guy who is taking control of his recovery without outing himself as a former opioid (ab)user to his doctor. (I can absolutely understand why someone would want to avoid that.) He's taking a microscopic amount of a very safe drug, which is exactly what a doctor would prescribe him. I promise, it's all good.  Once you start taking pills recreationally, especially as a young person, you have fundamentally changed your body's wiring to always need some tiny amount of opiate to feel normal and avoid withdrawals. It's just human physiology. It can take a long time to wean down and get off opiates permanently, because just stopping (called ""quitting cold turkey"") is EXCRUCIATING. It can't really kill you, but it's a week or two of hell, and then a few months of anxiety, depression, and just feeling like crap (called PAWS: post-acute withdrawal syndrome). As soon as you feel those first signs of withdrawal creeping up, you will do absolutely anything to stop it.  Of course, when you take your first recreational pill at a party or with a trusted friend, you have noooo idea how you're hooking yourself... until you're hooked. It is NOT a moral failing-- these are not bad or dangerous people, just young people who never thought it could happen to them. Anyway, since he's taking a packaged prescription product, the chances of it being doctored or dangerous is very very low.  The medication he's taking is safe, long-acting, and even has a medication in it (the naloxone) that prevents him from enjoying it or getting a high or building a tolerance.  Best of all, when you approached him about it, he told you about it right away and didn't hide it or get defensive.  (So you know, I'm an old lady, I work in healthcare, and I wouldn't steer someone like you wrong. You're basically my daughter's age.) Congrats on finding a good guy.

"Awesome dude!! So youve tried a sub program before? How did it go? I get recovery from t spreading evidence backed info how MAT programs are the way to go.  A lot of addicts think they can use will power this time to beat their opioid addiction and stop cold turkey. Some can, but the majority will relapse within a couple months. Addiction has nothing to do with will power. Using drugs has to do with will power, sure. But addiction in terms of the brain disease doesnt. Youre always going to crave and compulsively chase things that are pleasurable, bc we have a chemical imbalance. Not to mention the way opiates fuck up ur brain chemistry. Your brain doesnt produce nearly enough natural occurring opiates anymore after using  an outside source to get them. We will always crave opiates and have urges. Subs or methadone teaches you how to live live again without using everytime you experience a minor inconvenience. You learn how to cope without getting high, and it allows you to fix yourself. Its been shown programs of at least a year or more, by far have the best success rates. Once youve got a stable job, your own living situation, transportation, and a solid support system, then you can decide when to taper off subs.

This can cause issues - such as if you ever go to the hospital for anything, your leg will have to be hanging off to get opioid pain relief. My GP is tapering me off Morphine at 10mg a week.  Despite me telling them several times that I cant cope or sleep and even writing them a letter, they refuse to provide any kind of support.  I took matters into my own hands. Ive ended up purchasing meds to help such as high strength Codeine and taking the odd Xanax to help me through the worst nights. Its a life saver (although expensive).  I can taper off at my rate and do things a bit slower and still be able to function.  If I were you, I would try not to relapse again (harder said than done I know) and if you do ever need opioid pain relief, only take it short term (for example one day a week at the most).

"For a low, continuous dosage: The first 2 - 4 months, I'm better than normal. Normally, I have issues like anxiety, depression, lack of motivation etc. On a low dose opioid, where I'm not really high, I just function perfectly and am in a good mood. Not high-good, more like just the perfect day. After 2 - 4 months, I'm feeling really bad when waking up and need the opioid just to be normal. Low on power & weak. Fortunately, I resisted the obvious urge to just up the dose and instead quit after 6 months. For a recreational, higher dosage: It's my favourite feeling. I enjoy life & just existing. Both a medium dose, where I still do ""normal"" things such as gaming, watching videos etc., as well as a high dose, where I just lay down and bathe in liquid light. Conclusion: Opioids are great for use in very, very rare occasions, compared to most other drugs. The high is about as good as MDMA, without the risk of lasting health problems or death (when used properly). Absolutely crucial though to not overdo it - then it becomes the forbidden fruit forever. A key aspect to all recreational drugs is: You should never get to the point where you realise that your life would have been better without drugs. Stop then, or, ideally, before.

You are so right that we do have agency over the dumb brain and finding that strength requires finding meaning and beauty :) My point is more towards the vulnerabilities of our brain.

I worked and worked until I got my next pay check and I used that money to treat my loved one and we started to have a better relationship and when I went to work I was withdrawaling at work and thats good because I was working and more focused at work and doing my work instead of feeling sorry for myself and worrying about how I felt. I was distracting myself from any symptoms of withdrawal that I had. Thats the answer to stopping, but if you cannot deal with your cold turkey feelings and wanna do one and only one to make that feeling go away then have at it.. but then you are only curving your withdrawals to be prolonged more and more time instead of trying to get rid of these withdrawal feelings as fast as possible.

She will need to have a dramatic change of lifestyle and get away from bad influences if she wants a fighting chance. Out of sight, out of mind.

Unfortunately this is facts, but you've been with him for three months. You found out about his Suboxone taking not by him telling gyou but by accident. I'd suggest trying to stop the drinking saying you'd like to take a break from it and see how it reacts. My guess is it will not be very amenable for him.

"There are two ways to start. The traditional method is to wait until you are pretty seriously into withdrawal (minimum of 12 hours since last dose of opioids but more is better), then begin by taking 2mg at a time up to 8mg in day 1, 16 in day 2-3, and ideally 8mg or less from that point on (most people are fine with 4mg/day after day 4 or 5). The problem here is A) suffering with WDs until you are ready to begin and B) the risk of precipitated WDs if you start the Suboxone too early, which can be really hard to calculate these days now that Fent is in everything and it stays in your system longer. You DO NOT WANT to experience PWDs so be very very careful here. The second option is called the Bernese ""Micro-Induction"" Method and it is the much better way to go IMO. Here you start by taking very low-dose amounts of Suboxone while you are still using the opioids you are planning to quit (Oxy, Fent, H, etc.). You keep using as normal but on Day 1 you take two .5 Mg doses of Suboxone. Day 2 you take two 1 Mg doses. Day 3 you take two 2 Mg doses. On Day 4 you take two 4 Mg doses and you cut the opioids in half. On Day 5 you can take up to 16 Mg Suboxone and at that point you really won't feel the opioid effects even if you try to do some. You will experience some level of discomfort at that point but not much and it will only last a day or two tops. From that point on you just go with a maintenance level dose of 4-8 Mg per day same as above. Either way, kicking Suboxone after prolonged usage is just as hard as kicking anything else so only use it as long as necessary to get past the danger zone for relapse. 1-3 months is fine. 1-3 years is a bad idea. Good luck! Please note: I am not a doctor. Please speak with your physician or seek other forms of medical advice before you make a decision on which way to go with all of this.

However, you've got what you've got and those medications should be helpful. I'm posting the microdosing schedule if you want to try that route. The Bernese method does involve continuing to use your DOC as the subs build up in your system. But even if you don't continue to use fent, if you start with a Suboxone dose of .5 mg (or even lower) at least your chances of precipitated withdrawal are significantly reduced. You can use the kratom to put some distance between the last fentanyl dose and first dose of subs. I doubt if you need to wait 5-6 days but the longer you can hold out the better.

"Low dose opioids are, short-term, the best anti-depressant. I used them like that, too. But between month 2 and 4, the effect goes to nearly 0, and then I'd have to increase the dose to get the same effect as before. No good solutions. For a while, I was happy with Tianeptine, which feels strangely similar to the low dose opioid euphoria. But it has the same problems of diminishing effect after 3 months, and it adds a whole new level of madness with its side effects. Easy to stop, but only in medical dose as prescribed!

I jumped off subs like four weeks ago and I was only on them since like September and I had gained like thirty pounds or something after having lost a bunch. Im pissed because now I have new stretch marks. ",2022-04-22T11:02:54+00:00,"opioids, prolactin, opioids, opioid, methadone, suboxone, subs",
"Well yeah. I do agree on the prohibition part. I was responding from the angle of reality in terms of the society that we live in and the way that it is. Unfortunately society doesnt view it all the same.  Sadly we cannot have the safe supply. Sadly in the case of many like myself too, even safe legal medications (opioids outside of MAT)  for chronic pain are not available. Maintenance meds are not the reason for the prohibition type approach we see here though.  I think seriously I'm sorry to hear that you don't get any mental health services at all. That's unfair. Have you sought out mental health care though? I assure you it is not reserved for people on maintenance. But I've got to say that in my experience and the knowledge I have from other people's experiences I've learned over the years, my MAT is in no way the reason that I receive mental health services. Personally I get them because I have chosen to put myself in intensive outpatient treatment, which I would have with or without them also having the option of supplying suboxone. And while I'm not in any way saying that any addicts whether on mat or not, tend to have resources at their disposal often, I don't really think that people on me too are catered too in terms of their mental health treatment either honestly. There is still a massive stigma around MAT. And being on mat does still have a disadvantage in terms of possibility of a patient needing additional mental health meds or anything narcotic. Many of us get told Suboxone or the 0.5mg Klonopin, sorry can't treat both.  Ultimately though MAT patients don't just automatically receive better mental health treatment. Unless they committ to getting it. I would think MAT patients have better mental health because they are usually trying to make changes in their lives and work some form of recovery. I am certain that my Suboxone is far from single handedly responsible for my increasing mental health and stability.  Almost always the poor mental health thing and not the other way around? Idk sorry I call BS. Yes addiction and mental health issues coexist quite often. But no matter how poor my mental health has been , it's never caused the things that the active using lifestyle does. My depression or mental illness doesn't make me commit felonies just to feel better for a little while. Or steal, lie, spend my rent money on frivolous shit bc I'm sad the way I would to feed the lifestyle. Mental health can certainly damper the lifestyle but it absolutely is not the reason people live the way they do in active addiction.  But to each their own I guess. Just a bit confused why your comment seems to be almost shitting on MAT as a tool or it having success with people getting help and changing their lifestyle. The help is out there. Though again for the record I don't at all disagree that the prohibition approach is detrimental. My point is just that, forgive me if I'm wrong here btw, you seem to think people on MAT are treated so much better by default and that their recovery work is irrelevant to their results ",2022-04-12T13:22:50+00:00,"opioids, suboxone, narcotic, Suboxone, Klonopin, Suboxone",depression
"If you don't mind thinking about opioids and taking them every day for however long just so you avoid feeling sick for a week or two. In my opinion take subs for a couple days after being totally clean for 24 hours. Like literally two or three doses and than just withdraw. I did it ten years ago, read a book to pass the time in rehab and fucked off from opioids ever since. My body doesn't seem to remember I ever did them, hasn't for probably 9 years.

It builds tollerance and you are not even high anymore. So I suspect that this relapse will cost me more than I thought. 3 days straight means that tomorrow I'll be fine with and feel it in a subtle way. Day 2 I'll have a bad hangover, day 3 start WD, probably doable, I can't stay off work. It will be in the best scenario as cold inside my skin, some chills, some gut discomfort. What make me hope is that I'wasnt high, no rush, nothing so good, just the tail of opis, that kind of sedation and far from feelings and problem. My gf has a rush and good high instead, so I think I ve skipped that part, one because I had full stomach, so I digest it slowly, and two because I was so tired the first time, usually when I was tired OPI doesn't hit strong as the same dose would do in the morning with right stomach absorption. So after all those thoughts, I believe I'll have some hangover/mild WD, and I can't and don't want to dose again. The first dose change my mind and it brings me inside the black hole, after the first week craving is not so strong, I mean it is strong but doable, before the first week I simply dose without thinking too much, and it sucks.

There's been a couple of times I've awakened and I take some Adderall and I will lay back down and fall right back asleep and then it'll be in intervals like that of just waking up briefly and then sleeping a few hours. I always feel like when I get the injectable form of something it's what gives me any type of side effect.   I was rx'd some 2mg strips just incase I start to get physical withdrawal symptoms.

"Considering you don't have much to compare it to, it all depends on how severe your body displays symptoms (and which ones are more prominent) and how you react to them. That being said, with 800mg of oxy you can probably taper properly and have little to no symptoms, but that's easier said than done. Understand during a taper you are not taking the drugs to get high, so don't fall in the trap of ""I don't feel anything lemme just take a little more"". The point is to have your body only expelling a small amount at the end instead of going from 120mg a day to 0 suddenly. Xanax and gaba will work wonders for sleep and restlessness and the kratom would take the edge off the withdrawal symptoms on its own, but that's a whole other substance you could very easily end up contending with their w/D's.

So there's a lot of factors to this. How much oxy were you doing and for how long. If you would doing more than 100 mg a day I suggest start up with 5 G. Also the powder hit you faster also the quality where did you get it from and the strain. Red train is usually the strongest the most the day 2 after that I will recommend the green strain.

"It tends to be significantly worse, but it definitely varies and depends more on the dose than it does the substance.  Acute physical withdrawal from oxy will have an earlier onset (about 12-14 hours full onset) and more rapid decline of symptoms (5-7 days for acute physical symptoms). Moderate and severe physical withdrawal symptoms are similar to other opioids...sweating, restlessness, nausea, diarrhea etc. Anecdotally, I've seen people coming off of oxy seem to have higher levels of anxiety and more of a ""manic"" initial post-acute phase than a depressive one that you see with heroin. The both settle into similar PAWS symptoms after a month or so, though. The issue with fentanyl (and this applies to all of the analogues out there) is that it's highly lipophillic, meaning fentanyl molecules stick to the fat cells in your body readily. The impact on withdrawal is that onset tends to be delayed (72 hours for full onset) and protracted (14-30 days of physical symptoms). Again, anecdotally, I see fentanyl addicts tend to suffer from pretty severe depression starting about halfway through detox and lasting upwards of 90 days. These are all people with very severe addictions, though. If your dose is closer to what you might call relatively ""moderate"" (<60 mg of oxycodone per day) and your fentanyl use is truly only occasional, you can expect a quick detox and might be able to handle it at home.  If you're dose is higher and you've been doing it for a while (more than 6 months), detox is definitely the way to go.

No one in my life and I mean, not a single person knows about my oxy addiction. I've tapered down from 100ish mg a day to 60mg in less than 3 weeks. I'm actually at 50-55mg as of today.  I'll go as low as I can with the oxy I have left then jump. I'm scared but also can't wait to be where you are. Like you i would pop 20g of oxy and then go meet with big wigs at office buildings (I own a bldg management co) then around 4pm pop another 20 mg and play with my kids, cook dinner with my wife and all take walks together. All while high. No one knew. If I didn't take those doses I'd be an asshole with a short fuse. We go to church every Sunday and I can barely stand the shameful feeling.  I can't wait to be in your shoes. At the same time, I still like being high. But I know that 90-110mg daily habit will eventually turn into even more.

"Thank you very much for the input and advice.  Thays exactly what i was looking for in a sense of if it was doable with having oxy on hand.   Its just so weird having anxiety like this.  Its the kind of anxiety i would get back when i was doing 120mg of oxy a day and couldn't get any for a couple days.   Idk why because i know i have the oxy rn as a fall back.  Im wondering if it also has to do with myself cutting back my clonazepam too much because thats a pretty potent benzo.  And i was on 3mg of xanax a day for 2 years then switched to clonazepam 2mg a day for the past year then over the past 3 months i went from that tolerence all the way down to taki g kess than a quarter of a mg because i was scared of interactions.   Even though i shouldnt be because i wqs taking the same amount of benzo when i was taking a lot of oxy.  These blue things just re-wired my thinking so differently and its hard to get past that.  I feel okay so far today other than lack of sleep from the anxiety i had last night and ive had maybe 3 pills today.  Insteqd of dosing half of a pill every hour ive been doing about a quarter to a half every two to three hours.  I think its just getting out of my own head is the hard thing to do.  Tomorrow ill start adding the oxy to my system in 10mg doses and i just need ro remember that im not trying to get high, im trying to quit the blue presses.  A few weeks sgo i ran out of the presses for two days but had oxy and i wqs trying ro chase the high and took almost 300mg of oxy in a day with zero high at all.  Was stupid and a waste and i think thats what has my anxiety up too because its in my head that it did nothing for me (getting high wise) so it makes me think it wont help or take care of the withdrawals, but in theory it would have to, right?  Because its still a potent full opiate and it has a longer half life than the presses.  Like i said, its hard to stay out of my head.   Ill try taking half a mg of clonazepam tonight with a 10mg oxy instead of dosing a blue press and see how i sleep with that.

And by real pharma oxy I mean not from a dealer who says its oxy, but from an actual prescription bottle you picked up at a pharmacy / or been using someone elses script. Because if the pills are not pharma, they definitely have fentanyl in them and then you need to be very careful with Suboxone, & wait until youre in full blown withdrawals to even try to take a tiny tiny piece (I recommend less than 1mg to start) to avoid going into precipitated withdrawals.

When I had horrific morning sickness, everyone was surprised by how functional I was while puking 24/7. Lots of practice I guess.  The lack of sleep was definitely another thing. I spent most of my addiction going to college in the day, working all night, getting my fix and then doing homework, sleeping an hour or two then doing it again.

I became addicted to being able to live a life with very little pain. I loved being able to do as I wanted.

It still works for pain though I have to take enough of it. It has taken so much from me and almost taken my life on more than one occasion.

I think that its important to say that opiates really long-term dont help with chronic pain.

And taking opiates makes you not feel that pain and you could be hurting yourself physically more and Ill never forget him saying that. Staying active is huge for me and so is trying to stay positive. Im not gonna pretend like I dont have days that are hell because I do but Im also no longer shooting heroin.

"Hot showers helped me. Heating pads. I get what you mean about the summer heat making RLS worse. I think general discomfort makes all wd symptoms worse. That's why I think withdrawing when the weather is cool but not cold was easier for me. If you have AC, try setting the temp a bit cooler. 100% cotton sheets and clothes. Try and eliminate as much discomfort you can. Instead of potassium pills, I just went with bananas and made sure I had sodium as well. NA and K are what make your muscles expand and contract, hence why bananas are recommended when you have muscle cramps. Make sure you're also stretching properly before and after working out. A lot of people skip stretching after. Also make sure you have enough protein in your diet to repair muscle tears from working out so recovery time is quicker.

It'll either be the tail end of the H WDs or the beginning of the Methadone ones if you were to keep taking Methadone.  As old mate said, your best bet is to jump off now and you'll hopefully be lucky and just get a few days of fatigue and feeling kinda shitty.  If you take pregabalin for that then when you stop taking the pregabalin you're gonna need to set aside a few days for the crash from that.. so either way there comes a point where you've gotta pay the piper.  You're probably already aware of all this but I thought it might be worth mentioning.  Promethazine or a similar anti histamine and a low low DXM dose (30-60mg) can be extremely helpful for WDs without carrying quite the same recreational potential (IMO) as Pregabalin and also not likely to cause a hangover that will make you want to cure it with more.  Apologies if you're already aware of pregabalins addictiveness or already have a habit, at which point my post is kinda moot. Good luck either way mate, you're doing well.

I'm personally not clean, I started on subs over a month ago and I'm starting to get my life back together, I'm using it as a tool to finally not be reliant on opiates. I didn't hit a rock bottom, I just ran out of seeds and got 5 days into withdrawal and couldn't take it, even after 5 days it was still building, seed withdrawals are a battle. I was working full weeks and most saturdays and some Sundays, I didn't hit a rockbottom but I am on a path to recovery, I've tapered off a 6 year codeine habit and was clean for about a year then not only did covid hit but a combination of life events that it is almost comical that they could all happen at one time, like the universe wanted me to relapse (that's a joke, I don't actually believe that, just a bunch of shit happening all at once during a pandemic that I could not handle) I turned to PST for over 2.5 years and was able to continue working a job that involves hard labour. Running out of seeds was a blessing, being on subs I have been able to regain the trajectory of my life, not claiming it's going to be easy to finally taper off the subs but after reading so many reports of others doing it successfully when dropping to as low as possible and skipping days and it being nearly painless it's given me finally the hope that I will actually be able to not be dependent on this stuff any longer. I also have the motivation from my clean time, I had never felt better in my life, it was awesome being clean, I felt great and that's a good motivator too. I know it probably doesn't mean much coming from me as I'm on subs and not technically clean but maybe a path like mine is an alternative, because if you don't want to lie and decieve your loved ones at least being on a suboxone program could be enough to no longer need to keep up that behaviour, maybe it will give you that breathing space to finally find it in you to actually want to be on the path of recovery. There are always other paths, you don't have to hit a ""rock bottom"" to find the desire to better your situation. Good luck either way.

You could do a rapid buprenorphine taper then jump to kratom. Its the only way Ive ever been able to abort withdrawals altogether and it requires discipline. Ive maintained pretty heavy habits of a variety of opioids and kicked/detoxed every which way you can imagine. And in my opinion there is no reason to not lessen the suffering.

Ive had times where my habit was so bad that the kratom wouldnt even touch it or I would have to take so much kratom that I would get the wobbles just to not be sick.

I just saw you said you cant get subs but Im too lazy to edit what I wrote, whatever. Usually what I do is taper down to less than 1 mg then hop on kratom. Usually the first day on kratom i fuck up and take more than I should and then am more disciplined. Its actually illegal in my state but I know a smoke shop that sells it. Anyway, once I get below 15-20 capsules (I think they have .4 g in them maybe .5) Ive essentially aborted withdrawal. Welcome to PAWS lol That being said, I also do low dose naltrexone while detoxing and I continue to do it after I kick. Right now Im taking 2-3 mg per day. Helps you bounce back faster. As far as other ways of minimizing withdrawals, there are some comfort meds and supplements. I know another poster mentions Advil. I dont really get bone aches but my muscles and back get sore from being in bed all day. I avoid Imodium because it doesnt agree with me. It severely constipates me and causes terrible cramping and I also sort of feel that if it needs to come out, it needs to come out. Zofran for nausea is amazing. Bentyl for stomach cramps. The other poster mentioned clonidine. This stuff works well but I only use it for a severe kick as it really fucks with your blood pressure and it makes me feel like Im going to collapse and slam my head into something. I cant stand the way it makes me feel. The clonidine patch is a whole different story. That thing works great. I guess probably due to a more even blood concentration and less peaks and valleys. And then benzos. I wont kick without them if I can avoid it. I hate the insomnia, its the worst symptom IMO. They also seem to make time pass by faster, which is nice if you dont feel well. Ive used scripted, non scripted (to me) but legit pills, and RC benzos to kick. Essentially what you want is to get the longest acting benzo available. Short acting ones like Xanax are better than nothing but they dont work as well and are more addictive due to the constant need to redose. You want to stay on this shit the least amount of time possible. But its honestly the biggest help out of anything else when youre really going through it, IMO. DXM helps as well, especially if you dont have much else to get you through it. 60-80 mg dosed periodically throughout the day. Just enough to zone you out. I also like to consume weed and tinctures when Im sick. Probably wouldnt without benzos, though. For supplements, magnesium helps the muscle cramps. And I just tend to take a number of vitamins and stuff when Im sick, especially when I cant eat well. Another thing I like to get are these things called Nuun, these electrolyte tabs. Helps you stay hydrated and its low in sugar. Its up to you how you do it, man. If you think you have he mental fortitude to taper the oxys before making the jump then try. If you think kratom can hold you right now and you can make the jump and taper, try that. I will just say that I once had a grand mal seizure from kratom (it was really lame) so I am always very weary of taking it and only take it with a benzo to lower the seizure risk. You might still have some inability to sleep and discomfort after the taper but it works. Or you can rough it out if you get some comfort meds. Do you have insurance? Detox is always an option although mine would always boot me after three days which is lame. Sorry for the wall of text. Good luck. Lmk if you have any questions.

I took like less than 1mg oxy pressie at night on day 10 and 11 cos I had toothache.  Then today I took maybe 2mg cos I had a social event and didn't want my family to see me weak.  But according to the other comments here, pregabs and soma are also opiates so iv still not experienced any withdrawals. I had no idea and I definitely felt WDs although quite weak compared to last time I went CT without pregabs or soma.

But, once in a while, you strip away the addiction and you're left with an asshole.  Folks that have serious untreated personality disorders can also be addicts. Just as you might run into someone like this at random, you might run into one at a meeting. The correct answer is do not engage. Shame doesn't work on people like this. They want the attention, no matter if that attention is negative. The negative attention just escalates the situation. You have to refuse to engage. Don't give her attention.

"Ok, so you have been trying to detox and you keep having to do so. So what youre doing isnt working.  Its time to work a program and get onto MAT. Take the sub the way its prescribed. Itll provide some stability so that you can do all the work in treatment to fix the problems that you have with youself and youe life that cause you to use. I get it, that as people with addictions, we are looking to do something 'quick'. It doensnt work like that. You sound alot like i did before i got into treatment. Spent over a year trying to detox every weekend. Life was nothing but a series of day 1, 2 and sometimes day 3s. Over and over again. I was scared to use sub as directed. Once i got into treatment and started taking it as a medication, instead of as another drug, everything got so much better. Ive been on it 14 months, and im starting to taper now, im taking about 5 mg, down from 8.  We all think we can do it alone, and be good as new in a few days. That might work if we were only using for a few days or weeks. For a many year addiction like mine, it takes alot more time to heal.  Best wishes to you, things will get better for you if you can accept some help. Edit: i noticed you said something about 'being addicted to subs'. Im sorry that the stigma against MAT has you thinking that way. Im going to post my reply to another person who was talking about the same stuff. ""The reason that MAT is so different from addiction, despite the body still being dependent on a form of opiates, is that relationship between the substance and the individual is different. With an addiction, we use our substance or behavior of choice in response to our feelings, right? So in my case, i used becuase i felt insecure and unworthy and not good enough.  Now MAT on the other hand, should be used the same as any other daily medication. So take the same prescribed amount, every day, same time. And then you dont need to think about it till you take it the next day. Thats the big difference, you just take it because its your medication, not because you feel something uncomfortable and itll make you feel better.  Ive come to understand that the specific substance or behavior or whatever that a person is addicted to doesnt define the addiction. I mean people get addicted to alcohol or opiates or porn or gambling, when other people do those things and arnt addicted. The difference is the relationship between the person and the object that fulfills their addiction. The person with an addiction needs some external thing in order to deal with their internal discomfort.  So i think that we just need to be very aware of our feelings and motivations to see what kind of relationships we have with outside things. Im sure some people are addicted to suboxone or methadone. People with codepencency are addicted to other people.....most people experiance their close relationships in a non addicted way. Alcoholics are addicted to alcohol, but most people have a beer and a burger and its just fine. Those kind of things are what i mean by it not being about the specific substance. So with that understanding of addiction, and close self examination, i think you can make a much better decision as to whether or not MAT would be a good thing for you. For me, i understood that addiction would eventually take everything good in my life. Towards the end there were an awful lot of close calls. I was skating on thin ice. I had used for 10 years, my whole adult life, and totally active addiction for the last 4 or 5. MAT gave me some stability to start to do the work and make the changes to unlearn the bad coping mechanism that is addiction. A year later, i can say 100% suboxone was the right choice for me. Everyones different, you gotta make that decision for yourself, understanding yourself and your own life and history. Recovery has been pretty heavy work to fix all the shit in my life that led me to an addiction, and all the resulting problems. MAT made it so i could get started on that stuff, which is really where all the good stuff of recovery happens.""

Did you take a sub at 48 hours? For me I went into a detox facility and they had me wait 72 hours since my last dose. They say fentanyl lasts a lot longer than heroin (which they make you wait 48 hours for that) so you have to wait a lot longer after your last use to take a sub. Now I know people on the street that do fent only waiting as little as 12 hours before taking a sub and having no symptoms. You could also try the Bermese method (microdosing suboxone) which I've read a lot of succes story about ,2022-04-06T22:16:34+00:00,"sub, fentanyl, heroin, sub, fent, sub, suboxone",
"Little WD symptoms? Don't dose. Moderate WD symptoms? Probably good but it's still a risk? Feeling like shit? You're good to dose. Also, some advice from being on sub maintenance long term & now tapering (almost done) .. try starting with a lower dose if it's bearable. From personal experience and a heavy fet/H user in the past, 16mg a day isn't necessary. You should be fine at 8mg a day. Any symptoms are usually mental. This only applies if you eventually plan on coming off subs. If not, disregard the advice. But if you are planning to come off, start at this point and it'll be a huge help down the road.

Yeah it's controlled and def has some WD effects of its own but compared to sun WD it's def an easier step down.  My sub Dr gave me a week script of gab and klonodine when I fully tapered.  I know what you mean about the bud. Never really liked the opiate weed combo so I basically quit smoking bud for a good 5-6 years. Now that I'm off opiates I def enjoy it again. A good indica works well for me or a hybrid. Straight sativa makes my mind race more than it already does and will give me panic attacks sometimes.

"This is all very well written out and good intentioned but keep in mind, the smallest tiniest piece of sub can throw you into precipitated withdrawal if you dont wait at least 24 hours (pharmaceutical pills they say 48 hours at least and heroin is what Im talking about, fent is a different ball game, if you are on fent do some really Solid researching and find the most common answer people are saying with their experience and use your best judgement, of course any professional help will go a long way also but there seems to be misinformation from doctors these days..not all..just maybe keep that in mind).  Basically the short answer is keep kicking until you literally cannot handle another second of wd, even then it would be wise to take  any meds (seroquel, depending on severity benzos and gabapentin etc) to push you further into the withdrawal process, to be even more safe, and then take the sub.  There is wisdom in taking a tiny piece however it will not throw you into AS much withdrawal as compared to for example if you took a whole 8mg at first.

"I did it millions of times. 5-9 day sub taper to go from shooting 1-2g heroin per day to zero opiates. It works great. Especially the first times you do it. And given that you are on pretty low doses, you have a good chance of going through it quite comfortably. What I dont understand, are you trying to get clean before your vacation, or are you using sub to get through your vacation? If I were you, I would go on sub about 2 weeks before your vaccay so youll have a few zero-days under your belt before you leave. By the time you leave home you should be physically ok and the fact that you are away from home will make it much easier to get it out of your head. About the doseI dont know how strong your h is and if theres fent in it, but if its actually heroin and about as weak as the stuff we have here in GERMANY, 2mg a day could be enough. You may need more on the first two days, but after that, you need quite a low dose to stay out of withdrawal.  So, if maintenance is your plan, take 2mg a day. You may need a second dose on days one and two. But after that, 2mg is fine. Splitting it up into two doses works even better.  If you wanna get clean, heres how I do it. Please note that Im usually comming from higher dosages, 1-2g IV real heroin a day:  I wait 16 hours. No fent, no need to wait longer. I take 2 x 4mg on day one. 4mg on day 2&3. 2mg on days 4&5. 1mg for days 6&7. Day 8 I take nothing. On day 9 I may take 1mg one more time if I feel rough. After that, expect occasional stomach issues and generally feeling a bit rough for a few days, but very manageable. And being away from home will make it much easier, because its out of your head.  Of course, thats only my personal experience, but I got clean like that dozens of times, definitely before every family vacation and it works.

I have a goal to have a normal life and own a house and have kids but even though im doing better now in life than I probably ever have before, it still all feels so unattainable and out of reach.   Not to mention I have a sneaking suspicion that the first signs of the legit apocalypse, collapse of modern civilization, whatever you wanna call it, are really gonna start rearing their heads this decade. I'd like to think I'd be strong if and when it all goes to shit, but it still sucks to think about. I hope I'm catastrophizing, but I'd rather hope for the best and expect the worst. The shit in Ukraine got me pretty convinced this is the very beginning of ww3. A shitty part of me that's likely informed by my ptsd is almost excited to start watching the world burn, just to like get it over with and see it all devolve into chaos.   Luckily the one thing that's absent in all of this is my desire to do any drugs- if the world is indeed gonna fall apart, I need my mind to be sharp for it. Sounds stupid as fuck but, just like at the beginning of covid where one of my first thoughts is how fucked addicts (esp homeless ones) will be, the other day the thought crossed my mind of how God awful terrifying it must be to be a junkie in Ukraine rn. Imagine tryna kick, not even of your own volition, but just because all your dealers are dead or gone, in the midst of bombs and air raid sirens?? Can't even go to the sub or methadone clinic cuz it's bombed too? Ugh. It makes me shudder to think about, fr. Of course there's much more important things to worry about in terms of that conflict, but I always think about the forgotten people, cuz I was one of them for so long.   Anyway. Im so stressed and I have this horrible lump in my throat like I just wanna be a lil bitch about things and cry, and I have so much to fucking do today when all I wanna do is take a day to myself to do nothing productive. But that's life. I'm grateful for the things in my life that are good, I really am. But it can be hard to keep functioning as normal when in the bsck of my mind the prospect of life as we know it ending seems not too far away.   Oh well. I'll deal with it, I always do. Life is exponentially better now than it was 3 years ago. My coworkers said they're gonna make me a cake shaped like a dope baggie for my 3 years clean date in a few weeks, so there's that which cheers me up  I'm glad they're able to partake in my self deprecating, self aware (I try at least lmao) sense of humor with me.

Its better you get on the subs and work through your packed away trauma, actually making use of the time youre on them, and get off them later when you are not so sensitive to triggers- than to get off them before youre ready and and up using again.  so what Im trying to say is, if you do get back on the subs, make sure that you are in an inpatient or outpatient treatment, therapy, CBT, DBT etc. while on the Suboxone so that you can make the most of the time you are on them.

"No problem, if you are going to search for a telehealth program there is a lot of info on that sub. Just make sure you look up the laws for telehealth services where you live and then find a service that serves your area. So when covid hit almost every state where I am put an emergency order in place giving any doctor the authority to prescribe to any state, now that those state of emergency laws are being lifted a lot of states have gone back to only providers that are licensed in your state can prescribe. So when this happened in my state I was switched to a provider that was licensed in my state. Theres been a lot of bashing on the suboxone sub lately because people arent understanding whats happening, but this issue isnt a problem with the telehealth services its a problem with the state they live in.

Ive had 34 major surgeries in the last few years from brain to feet. I have pain. Managing it with cannabis and other holistic practices is a win for me. And sublocade saved my life & allowed me to avoid withdrawal which was amazing considering my leg was in an external fixator at the time (kicking with bars coming out of your bones would SUCK). I dont bother worrying about the labels or judgments on whether others think Im clean, I care that I am stable, happy, productive, and at peace :).  words have power. Im not a fan of limiting labels. Im more than someone whos had an addiction, Im more than someone with serious health issues.. I simply am. I refuse to say hi Im XYZ, Im an addict, every time I speak at fellowship meetings. Why should I reinforce the notion that Im disordered RIGHT after I say my name, time and time again? The brain can/does heal the chemical dysfunctions that qualify the disease. I like to align myself with terms that mirror my desires. Instead of saying Im sick, I say I am healing.   I need to stop you though- its not the drug. Addiction is a maladaptive coping mechanism for poor mental health and/or trauma. Its not about the substance, its about the need to numb. Whether its opiates or another drug you prefer- the desire to numb is the issue. Its an invitation to explore where you need healing.  Youre still having panic attacks daily - are you doing therapy? Fellowships are NOT a substitute for therapy. Addressing your trauma and mental illness is way deeper than listing a moral inventory and telling some other person. It should be done with a qualified practitioner such as a therapist. I wish more ppl in the programs acknowledged this. If youre needing benzos for anxiety, you should be in therapy working on it, imo.  I highly recommend doing other things to manage anxiety in addition to your medication. Therapy, breath work, tapping (my therapist just taught me this- it helps regulate an overactive/traumatized nervous system), and other mindset work  Your diet could be impacting your mental health. 90% of serotonin is made in the gut. A healthy gut = a healthy mind. There are two types of food allergy. One is a histamine response that causes anaphylactic shock and or hives, swollen lips etc. but another is depression and anxiety up to 2-3 days after consuming the food. So eliminating inflammatory foods could help. And daily exercise is sooo helpful. When Im anxious, I get a serious sweat on with Pilates and yoga & im always in a better mood with a body buzzing full of dopamine.  Im not saying dont use medication for anxiety, but if you need medication for anxiety, you should also be doing everything else to help heal your nervous system. Good job on kicking fent. That ish SUCKS. Keep up the good work. Dont worry about the labels. Also check out sublocade. 1000x better than subs. Its a once monthly bupe injection. It helps you break the ritual of taking a substance everyday to be okay. It fully saturates your receptors and is an excellent blocker, which is always good insurance in early recovery. After the smallest, final injection, the body slowly metabolizes the bupe over about 1 year, creating the perfect self taper. Most of us who used sublocade avoided withdrawal, which is HUGE. Im over 2 years off sublocade. I cannot recommend it enough.

I know a lot of people in AA/NA are against suboxone but try that. It helped me get a year so far and have no thoughts of relapse. Helps get your life back together.  I think it helps because it distances you from that lifestyle while helping with cravings. That way when you get off you already are out of the lifestyle habit therefore less likely to relapse.

"Absolutely - thats what inpatient rehabs do. I went to one where it was a 7 day detox in their medical center then the 30 days after were more in a therapeutic center- now I dont think theres a place where you can go inpatient and it manages PAWS - bc that lasts several months and sometimes a couple years. There are rehabs that will take you in for 60-90 days - but usually those arent covered by your insurance. You will never come out cured or without any symptoms - especially with suboxone withdrawals - yes you wont have physical withdrawals when you come out - but the depression, anxiety, general malaise - thats going to take a lot of work and a support system and take a couple years. Unfortunately theres no easy way around it and most healing doesnt start until youre out of those places and actually dealing with real world problems again. I did a 90 day program and healed a lot but as soon as I got back into the real world and faced any stress again - I started spiraling bc I didnt have that support system and was living under the pink cloud and thought I had it figured out. Rehab can sometimes be detrimental if too long bc you dont worry about bills or getting a job or really any adult responsibilities - but as soon as you get it - it hits you in the face hard and you have to learn how to live life without substances and learn how to feel your emotions and all that ",2022-03-12T02:11:48+00:00,suboxone,"depression, anxiety, malaise"

Theres tons of resources that can help to encourage mindfulness and letting go of expectations. It can seem silly to some people, but the biggest part of recovery for me has been these cognitive changes which have led me to also change my behaviors.

Im physically dependent on my asthma medication too. Im not in a state of addiction right now though, all you have to do is look at the behaviors. I think its a kind of purposeful lack of self awareness that people refuse to understand this distinction. Second, i think theres alot of people who didnt use MAT, and they feel like it cheapens their own experiance for other people to get sober in not the hardest way possible. Its kinda similar to how older americans think that because they were able to have a middle class life on a single income, that everyone else should be able to as well. I think its kind of an insecurity, the desire to see others suffer in the same way that one has previously experienced. Anyway, for each of us, our recovery is ours alone, so we must each determine our recovery for ourselves. At the end of the day, my choice to use MAT doesnt have anything to do with anyone else, just like it doesnt matter what i think of anyone elses recovery. It frustrates me that people are often so negative towards people using MAT, im sure there are people that dont end up getting sober, because some jerk told them that being on medication 'isnt clean'. To each their own, but if you have only negative things to share, think real hard whether sharing them would be beneficial to everyone involved. ",2022-04-14T20:22:18+00:00,suboxone,

Methadone is the other option and idk how the clinics work in the UK but its a pain in the ass in the US and Im pretty sure you still have to go in every damn day. Not only that, methadone is a way more grueling and painful habit to kick. Buprenorphine withdrawals are actually far more minor than oxy, morphine, heroin, etc. because it is an only a partial mu opioid receptor agonist. In any case, it takes a bit of time to bounce back after kicking. The first week would be the worst, sleep would probably come in a couple. But even after acute withdrawals you are left with PAWS and Id say that takes ~90 days for the fog to really clear and energy levels to restore.

"The only thing I'd worry about with MAT is that it sounds like he's been abusing suboxone already. Suboxone and Methadone definitely have a much lower risk for abuse, but if you've already done it, there's going to be a time early on in the treatment during which you'll be pretty vulnerable to relapse. I personally couldn't do MAT precisely because of this, I had to do inpatient rehab for a couple of months to get clear of the initial shit, then ongoing clinical treatment + AA to stay on this side of sobriety.  But you're absolutely right. It's tough seeing all the people who post on this forum saying something like ""If I can just get past the withdrawals, I'll be good"", because that's the addiction talking. You won't be good, you may as well be scheduling a relapse.  But it's nearly impossible to get them to change course right in this moment. I always try to say something that at least puts the thought in their mind that this is a major, ongoing lifestyle change...if they aren't ready to hear it, well, nothing we can do. But if the seed is in their mind, hopefully it'll sprout before it's too late for them. ",2022-03-09T16:03:26+00:00,"suboxone, Suboxone, Methadone",
"Quotingg your comment for easier replying.    A lot of people view it as trading one addiction for another, but don't realize that a lot of people need something slow and steady.   I can see this one. I agree for sure. I disagree with one minor semantic. Trading , sure. However I don't see how trading in active addiction, which obviously entails abuse as well as typically the associated lifestyle, an exchange for medication under the care of the doctor is considered trading one for another really unless that person is abusing of the treatment from the doctor and not using it to recover. To me, it makes as little sense as saying if I had something like a self-medicated mental illness that I chose to seek treatment from a doctor for.. unless I was like snorting my mental health medication or Miss using it some other way then I don't see how it is a trade-off. If addiction is considered a disease then I struggle to see the shade people throw at those who seek treatment for it even if in the outsiders eyes it appears to be a trade-off. Especially since addiction is not a curable disease. So either you trade off, you continue on in your addiction, or last option I see is trying to aim for the best possible treatment available for an illness that really does not have a cure.  Tldr: I do agree with you haha.    Unfortunately a lot of doctors have been keeping patients on suboxone for a lot longer than they need to be, which is another reason a lot of people warn about it.   Once again I do agree. However, wow many people that you Suboxone realistically could and should get off at some point.. warnings are helpful when they are delivered right way for sure. Sadly many people tend to just tell horror stories about it, and even to such an extent that I love warnings they are giving can easily be more harmful than the actual reality of staying on the medication. I can't even tell you how many times I've had I'm solicited opinions thrown at me about this. Typically if used solely for maintenance and there's a much better chance that getting off of eventually is probably best. People fail to realize that medications are prescribed for various reasons though. When I tell people that my form of pain management is Suboxone I get shit on sometimes even worse than those who spend some time on it for me and.  And when it comes to debilitating lifelong chronic pain, it gets old hearing shit like that you know? Unless whatever editor coming at me is my pain management doctor which has never happened, and most often the people warning may have no clue why I'm even honored, it is just so unsolicited, from a place lacking relevant medical info, and sad way often lacking and a concern. Don't get me wrong some warnings are genuine, but I've got to say I have seen many warnings given on here that are very clearly given maliciously with the intent to put the person down by pretending they care.  A lot of people that take it to taper also end up hooked on it, so some people may want to warn others about that risk when a lot of doctors wont tell you about the consequences because they're making money off of it.   Good point.  At the same time though, being hooked on something like this is a lot more harm reduction than many of the alternatives. I'm aware that there are consequences of course, as well as the grade for money in this industry. But I still tend to believe that this has to be and some way better than me alternative. I've been on 4 years so far and the side effects I experienced while on for likeness absolutely blue any side effects I get now completely out of the water. I am fortunate love that my treatment does not cost money, the IOP place that I use that offers Suboxone does not charge any money so long as you are insured.  So when I think about it as crazy as it is to realize, my four years this route have been infinitely cheaper than the year prior spend on full agonist as well as without pretty much any side effects that I can think of. I know not everyone is that lucky though, I wish they were  All that being said, I personally think MAT is necessary for a lot of people and it absolutely saves lives. But it also has a potential for abuse (a LOT of clinics do not properly monitor their patients, give out huge doses, etc.) and I believe that should be  Wow it seems like pretty much a grade with every point you've made haha. Yes there are potentials for abuse in various forms but that can be said for all of the other opiates as well. And sad boy with those ones, it's more often that people go far enough to fake injuries get opiates, way over case much stronger ones and are more likely to overdose, lastly, I know this opinion is taboo but I actually can see benefit to overprescription of maintenance type meds. Suboxone is wildly overly prescribed, it is also unaffordable to a number of people and with those things said I think that the situation enables people that do need these meds but would not otherwise be able to obtain them to have a shot at being able to get what they need. I admittedly spent some time in my early recovery having to go this route. Not at all ideal, but I found that staying on something like heroin instead over such a stupid reason can't be anything but a detriment to be possibility of recovery ever.happwning.

"You're coming down from an extremely high dose of suboxone, I weaned down to 2mg and still have severe withdrawal symptoms OP. Suboxone is STRONG, a lot stronger than most people realize. Keep in mind this is what they often give to stop fentanyl withdrawals...which means your body still hasn't withdrawn from the dose it was on. When I was coming off fent, I was able to get well on 4mg a day after lowering down from 8mg the first 3 days. If you'd done a fast taper over the course of a week instead of staying on one high, consistent dose, you would have been okay to stop it. 16mg is a long term maintenance dose. If you have the ability, PLEASE taper down first before dropping cold turkey. If you have trouble cutting your dose in half, you may need to look into a slower taper because it's going to be no different than dropping off of your DOC.

Are you planning on going on suboxone long term or just to taper? Suboxone is very strong. Im not surprised that they are giving it to you but it does upset me that they are doing this.

"No problem, glad you figured it out. I got on suboxone when I was 17 weeks pregnant. Before that, I was on Vivitrol, I switched medications. I switched to an OBGYN at my city's hospital who specializes in women with substance use histories early on in my pregnancy, and that was a good move for me. They were very supportive. When I gave birth at the hospital, though, I was treated very poorly. My epidural failed during labor and the anesthesiologist on staff that night did not believe me. It was a traumatic experience for me, and here I am almost a year later still suffering mentally from it sometimes. My advice would be to make sure your support system is strong, have one person with you to back you up at all times. Sometimes you have to get firm with staff who aren't as familiar with people who have a substance use background. Aka who perpetuate the stigma. Also, have the phone number for the hospital's patient advocate department saved in your phone, and don't be scared to call them if you need help advocating for what you want/need with the medical staff.

"I hope one of the suboxone experts here can answer your main question. Until then, don't worry about taking benzos for a few days in a row against anxiety, unless you have an addiction problem with them as well. Just use a dose that takes the edge off the anxiety, not more than you need. My copy & paste advice for opioid withdrawal in general:  Vitamin C, possibly mega-dosing (I didn't mega-dose myself) Vitamin D, at the very least no deficit. (I took a lot more: 125 micrograms D3 per day in combo with K2 MK7. Having no deficit is well proven to be very very important; anything above is still in research. But seems logical to take the highest, somewhat safe amount, rather than that absolute minimum, until the worst is over.) Loperamide: Go easy on that, not much more than the official instructions allow and not more than you need to counter diarrhoea. I think it'll be strong enough to solve that problem entirely. Keep hydrated while the diarrhoea lasts! Benzos: If they are not also your vice, they can be your friend here, especially for sleep. I played it very safe by only using like 1 or 2 quarter pills through the 2 main nights, but could have taken more. If already prone to depression, it helps a lot to start on an anti-depressant ASAP, even while still using (but check if it's safe with opioids. Agomelatin is safe to use with many drugs, and helps with RLS and sleep, but it is one of the less effective ones.)

From the MULTIPLE NEGATIVE ENCOUNTERS I've had on reddit and Facebook with PEOPLE who either went abstinent... or ARE ON AN ANTI SUBOXONE CAMPAIGN.. cus they were advised ( I'm assuming properly advised to use it as a crutch to help with wds...and that you were then also going to have to taper off suboxone as well) to use it to help with withdrawl .. and then because they either bought it off the street without being consulted or got it from a doctor and negated the consulation... they had to go thru the buprenorphine withdrawl on top of the opiate withdrawl and they have a gripe with it Then theres also suboxone patients who hate it but also take it . That will suboxone shame other patients who take a higher dose  I think it all boils down to .. THEM TAKING THEIR ISOLATED INCIDENTS/EXPERIENCES and projecting them on to the general public.

"Yeah I did but Ill post it here again. The short version, I dont know for sure but I would for at least 2 weeks until all the suboxone is out of your system.  Response: As for you question, truthfully I am not sure. I wondered the same. The way I see it is buprenorphine has a long half life and considering I have been taking it for several months, I would think you should take it for 10-14 days after stopping the suboxone because technically you do still have bupe in your system. For example, people who start vivitrol (naltrexone extended release injection) after suboxone are usually instructed to wait 14 days minimum until starting vivitrol, some suggestions say one month even.  The beauty behind this method, according to the study, is the naltrexone displaces buprenorphine more gently and gradually than other opiates. The gradual increase in naltrexone dose doesnt send you into PWD I am assuming. But if you discontinue the naltrexone prior to all the bupe being out of your system, the buprenorphine will bind once the naltrexone is out of your system and then you essentially are back on buprenorphine.

"I keep it simple. Im also not on MAT but have been clean over a year. The relationship with suboxone is entirely different than fent. You get a controlled substance in regular intervals that allows you to get your life back if you work for it. It has a much longer half life so you dont need to dose as often. Look into the study they run in England through the NHS. They literally give people who have treatment resistant addiction free medical grade heroin. To me MAT is a step in the right direction. Its not a lifetime solution but it has the potential to make your life so much better.

I hate to say it but the mental part going away never really happens. It will get less and less for sure but at times you will think about it. I used for like 14yrs. When I finally decided to stop I didn't go inpatient. I did it at home with suboxone. The first few months my mind was thinking about it alot and I was dreaming about it too. I just kept telling myself how easy it would be for me to end up dead like my brother whenever I had any thoughts. You never know what is being put into what you buy. You go buy a pill or a bag and end up dead cuz it's fentanyl or even worse Carfentanyl (that's what killed my brother. My brother went out of state to a program. He got kicked out of the program when his insurance got cut off after a month. Then he found a shady sober house that made him manager and was driving the van for the clinic they went to. He ended up dead with his body dumped inside the van from the clinic left in a random driveway with empty narcan and needle. His toxicology showed only Carfentanyl in his system no heroin or fentanyl like I know he was seeking. Whoever he was with obviously tried to save him with Narcan and panicked when it didn't work so they drove him in the van then ran off taking the car keys with them so it was clear he didn't drive himself. Maybe some place near you does outpatient treatment you could go to. You're young enough that you have a real chance at being successful in recovery. Your parents probably think you going to stay in a place is best but that's not always the case.

Do not take the suboxone without tapering on with the Bernese method. You have to keep some fentanyl in your system as you build up the suboxone or you will be too sick with precipitated withdrawl.

Its a microdosing induction of suboxone. You start with continuing to use fentanyl and slowly titrate the suboxone.

"So if you were going to go into PWD that would have happened when you took 3 suboxone strips regardless of your DOC. So you probably were getting heroin.   Thats a lot of suboxone and even though its a high dose you arent going to feel great because it is only a partial agonist. We will never feel on suboxone what we felt on heroin or other opioids.  Its binds our opioid receptors but doesnt activate them fully like a pure agonist would.  So you may still have some fatigue and mental symptoms but you should mostly feel okay physically.  How did you feel when you used your gear?  Any better?  I would be surprised if your gear was actually working after that amount of suboxone. It has a very long half life as well and usually will block other opioids up to 72 hours after use and today (3 days later, right?) it is just wearing off.  Tell me how you felt when you took your gear as I am inclined to think your receptors are covered with suboxone and you are fine to just start taking suboxone at a normal dose and schedule. If you did feel you gear then I would suggest the Bernese method rather than suffering for 24 hrs again or risking PWD.  Let me know if you want a detailed idea on doing the Bernese method.

"My opinion would be to keep trying to call your dealer and if you are friends enough just go to his darn house lol that's what I would do if I knew them good enough.  Or go try cold copping in the known homeless areas. As for the suboxone, you'd be surprised how much a little does.  If you were using real heroin then you don't have to wait as long as the fentydope out there.  Start small like .5mg and let it dissolve under your tongue.  Wait a hour and if you don't feel worse then repeat. At 1mg you will feel something let up as a sickness. Again if your not feeling worse after another hour then repeat again but I would stop at 1.5mg to 2mg and let it kick in.  Not being on it it might take a bit to connect to those receptors. You shouldn't be puking with 2mg just induced into your body.  Key thing is slow wins the race.  Last thing you want to do is feel worse. Precipitated withdrawl is x100 and I know because I went through it from fent. Then I learned on my second attempt and went slow and let the suboxone kick in slowly.

"So you need to find out what method the hospital uses to score NAS in newborns. There are two different scoring methods, I can't remember the names of them right now, but please call the NICU and schedule a phone consult with them NOW so you can ask questions before you get there. Get a copy of the scoring sheet. Demand to be present every time they score baby. Ask them not to score baby until he/she has been fed - if baby is hungry or uncomfortable, NAS scores will be artificially higher. Ask what visitation policy is for parents with a child in NICU. I was thankful that my husband and I could visit the NICU 24/7, although only one of us could stay overnight. The rooms were tiny with only one small pull out couch so I guess that's why that was that. We lived close enough that we went home every night to sleep in our own bed, but trust me, we were there all day every day for my baby's entire 12-day NICU stay. If anything doesn't make sense to you, demand that they explain it to your satisfaction. You HAVE to be your baby's advocate, seeing as they can't advocate for themself. There will be medical professionals who treat you/your baby badly because of you being on suboxone. File a formal complaint against them (via patient advocacy) if they are disrespectful. Otherwise things won't change. You can request/demand that a specific nurse not work with your baby. I overheard one nurse say that my baby was ""gobbling up all the donor milk, "" she was the only full term baby in the NICU at the time she was there. She was really rude about it and treated us like we didn't deserve the time of day. I got her name and demanded of the charge nurse that she not be assigned to my child again.  Don't be afraid if baby has to do a methadone taper. My baby did a 7-day taper during her NICU stay. She is 11 months old now and is perfectly healthy. Make sure they write down the taper schedule for you. And remember, you'll have the patient advocate number, don't be afraid to use it. File a formal complaint against anyone who treats you unjustly.

That's definitely a myth! I remember being super afraid of that before I started. Your health records are confidential. There's no way any other doctor will know you are on suboxone unless you tell them or transfer them your medical records.  There are some dangers mixing those meds though. Keep that in mind but the whole black box thing is definitely a myth. I got prescribed narcotics and anxiety meds while on suboxone from an urgent care. You have to sign a release form and everything to transfer your records to another physician. It's a whole process.  What kind of blood work though? Did they check your thyroid levels?

PWD comes when you take a large enough dose of Suboxone (typically 4 mg or more) while you still have full agonist opioids in your system and they are suddenly, not gradually, replaced. There is a lot of info on this method out there. Just search ""Bernese Micro-Induction"". I have done it more than once and it is far better than the traditional Suboxone induction method.

"Thats a hard one to answer because it really varies from person to person. I would holdout as long as you possibly can.  Once you literally cannot take it anymore (hopefully youve made it to around 36 hours or more), regardless of how long youve made it I would make sure to take no more then 0.5mg of suboxone every 40 minutes. The 40 minute gap between 0.5mg doses is enough time for the piece of sub you took to kick in enough for you to notice if it is making things worse. So after 40 minutes have passed if it hasnt made things worse then take another 0.5mg piece and wait another 40 minutes. If it ever makes things worse instead of better, its probably in your best interest to stop taking the sub and hold out some more time, which will suck, but if its making things worse instead of no change/better then yeah you gotta wait more time. Anyways if you are able to make it to 3mg by dosing 0.5mg every 40 minutes then you are in the clear. You wouldve had PWD well before reaching 3mg. I just personally find it more comforting to ease into subs if Im coming back from a relapse because the pwd when jumping into a high dose of sub all at once is traumatizing its so bad. But yeah so getting up to 3mg will end up taking you 240 minutes which is 6 hours of time.. its nice since it gives you an objective to reach on the clock and shit for me personally it sort of gives me motivation (mentally atleast since Im usually dope sick rolling around In bed with cold ass feet kicking and wanting to scream rolling around hot cold hot cold *pukes in bucket, dry heave dry heave, walk to bathroom and rinse it out flush it change my clothes while Im up and grab a new blanket and set it on top of my sheets along with switching comforters and throwing the other one over a railing with a fan on it. Sometimes i also like to just sitinfront of a space heater and be hot as fuck. I hate being hot and cold its miserable, being just hot is less miserable to me, but then you gotta make sure youre hydrating even more so.. since (honestly Im not sure since either way Im sweating profusely).. but maybe you sweat more in the heat idk, but keep taking sips of water and shit. But yeah. Every 40 minutes 0.5mg. If things get worse then hold on tight. But dont give up, youre so close. 31 hours ago is a long time. Just hold on as long as humanly possible before trying to induce with the subs and then take smal amounts every 40 minutes (no more then 0.5mg) and then the worst case scenario is you get to 1-1.5mg ish and it makes you feel worse, but it beats 8mg making you have full blown nuts PWD. If you have any clonidine, gabapentin, lyrica, or benzos (be especially careful with the benzos).. I personally hold out as long as possible and then when the onset of wd starts coming Ill take a low dose of benzos just enoughto take the edge off along with some gabapentin preemptively for whats about to come.. Then when wd is full force Ill just pop some gabapentin every couple hours so itmetabolizes better along with clonidine and an hour before bed time Ill take a larger dose of benzos. Usually if I have benzos gabapentin clonidine it makes it a bit more bearable, but if you dont have any of those things dont even worry since youve already made it to 31 hours youre a tank.

For me, suboxone still got me high, still blocked me from feeling emotions, and I still sought out addictive behaviors( snorting suboxone, taking more than needed, buying on the street, withdrawing if I had none). Also it is directly supporting the pharmaceutical industry who profit immensely off addicts.  Vivitrol, is for relapse prevention once you are already clean for 2 weeks, its a monthly IM shot in your butt, and the active ingredient is call Naltrexone(read about it and consult addiction professionals). It binds to your opioid receptors acting as a antagonist, so when you decide to use opiates/alcohol/kratom, you will not get the associated high and you can get ill and very sick. So for me, I know I dont want to use anything but marijuana, and if I get the smart idea I want to use opiates, I know I cant. Its a deterrent and a effective meAsure in staying clean.

"I will take this into consideration, im planning on telling my psychiatrist i can go into withdrawal without needing the suboxone, but it is true that the mental cravings are the hardest part for me.  i am diagnosed bipolar, and when i am going through a depressive episode i tend to use substances as a release. im pretty self aware of my situation at this point.  tomorrow instead of starting suboxone im going to cut it off cold turkey with the assistance of clonidine and ondansetron (nausea medication). i also have access to several anxiety medications (not benzo) and immodium.

Big difference.  Alot of people will yell about 'subs arnt clean', but i think thats really just an ego thing, that they feel like theyre better because they didnt use MAT.

"Bro please take this advice. Go to a suboxone clinic and start a suboxone program. What you mentioned didnt include any form of treatment for your addiction whatsoever.  Drugs arent your problem. Drugs are only one symptom of addiction, not the cause. Even if you successfully get off opioids with ur plan, you still have a brain disease that doesnt go away. Youre going to still compulsively chase some form of dopamine or endorphin rush. Relapse rate of opioid addicts is above 85% within 6 months of getting off opioids. MAT programs drastically increase ur chances and are the gold standard for opioid addiction with the highest success rates by far. Take this how you want, but everything I said is based on proven science and data. ",2022-03-09T08:37:16+00:00,"suboxone, suboxone, opioids, opioid, opioids, opioid",

Honestly I have a pretty bad fetty habit about 30 pressys a day so Id say at least 3g since I can do a half g at a time and it feels the equivalent of maybe 3-5 pills. Regardless I tried time and time again to get onto suboxone and it was hell each time even microdosing. Everyones different but from personal experience I would wein off your fetty to a minimal dose like basicly hit a point when you feel sick or your daily amount should be down to like 2 hits one in the am and pm to keep you from being super sick after you adjust to this I would then do the micro dosing method of introducing suboxone like others have mentioned. Personally with my heavy and long abuse of fetty it has been built in my system to such an amount I need to wein off before introducing suboxone or it wont do anything and will take forever to transition. At the moment I decided to try methadone cause I can never stay sober on suboxone and I have legal issues that dont allow me the time to try and ease my way back onto suboxone without going cold turkey. I have no personal experience in this but from what I have heard it can be a lot easier to use methadone as a bridge to kind of taper yourself down and get onto suboxone. At the same time if you go on to high of a dose for to long it can be hell so it seems like its all in how you use it. I got a little bit off topic lol but I hope it helps and remember regardless of what people say or think you got this and your taking steps in the right direction thats all that matters! ,2022-03-23T22:09:43+00:00,"suboxone, suboxone, suboxone, methadone, suboxone, suboxone, methadone, suboxone",
"I'm sorry you're going through that, I know it's tough. What side effects did you have on suboxone? I only had constipation .  You've really got to force yourself that last little bit to taper off. I took 4 months longer than I should to taper but my addiction aprn was soooo supportive to me. It's like a second withdrawal even though you are using a fraction of a MG every few days!  You know yourself better than anyone, and if you think you'd relapse to harder drugs than suboxone then I'd suggest you stay on it. Micro dosing suboxone is better than heavy opioid use. Maybe talk to your doctor/addiction person and see what they say? Maybe they can help you get over that last hurdle.  How is your life going though? Are you fairly stress free depression under control, etc? If any of those are a big problem, they might be your issue in kicking suboxone.  No matter what, you are doing fantastic! Keep it up.

"Yeah, suboxone is like that. I don't have much experience with tapering it, but I know someone who would rip off the tiniest piece off a strip (definitely less than 0.5 mg) and they swore when they'd stop they'd get WDs. Especially if you've been taking suboxone for a long period like a year. It has a long half-life and builds up in your system. So staying at 0.5 mg should've been done for at least 2-6 weeks IMO, if not longer. I did jump immediately off suboxone though (2 mg per day) after like 2 months and I experienced small WDs for like 1 month. I'm talking about cravings, sweaty palms and feet constantly, anxiety, trouble sleeping, etc. The next few weeks might not be ideal, but surely better than living depending on oxy. Edit: if you feel like you need to go back on suboxone, there's nothing wrong with that. Zubsolve may be a cheaper option for you. Same thing as suboxone - they even have the first 2 or so scripts for free with coupons. Idk if they still run that promo but it may be worth checking out if you decide to go down that road.

"The withdrawals from 16mg suboxone are severe, if you have more suboxone to last a taper please do so. Even if your life is already fucked right now, it can always get much, much worse and you DO NOT deserve that no matter what you may think. You deserve to feel better and you will. I saw your post about how you have pills left, and that the doctor you got them from didn't give you a taper/but that you're going back soon. That's because most suboxone clinics tend to be long term treatment plans where you go back and work with them until you get your life under control again. THEN they usually have you taper off once your life is stable again.  But if this isn't what you want, you really need to speak to your suboxone doctor and be honest with them and ask about a taper plan (especially if you cannot consistently afford going back to them). They'll help you work out a best case scenario for YOU. ",2022-04-18T02:02:44+00:00,"suboxone, suboxone, suboxone, suboxone",
My advise is to look up the Bernese Method of suboxone induction. This way allows you to fully transition on to suboxone with little to no withdrawal. Then once you're stable on subs I would look in to switching to Sublocade. Coming off of Sublocade is incredibly easy. You basically take one injection each month for 3-5 months...then just stop. You will have little to no withdrawal whatsoever. This is exactly what I did and I basically had no withdrawals at all at any point. Seriously. I've been in this game for 10 years and this is THE way to do it. ,2022-04-13T05:44:41+00:00,"suboxone, suboxone, subs, Sublocade, Sublocade",
"Yes 16mg is high - but youve only been on it 2 weeks. With a longer taper plan like this one (which is great - depending on your situation - but consider.) This means 5 weeks of staying on suboxone. Add another 2 weeks for when youre cold turkey, you will be fatigued whatever. So 8 weeks from now youd probably feel more new. By July/August youd be right as rain! Yay! If you cold turkey your two week usage- yeah itll suck balls . But I bet youd feel a lot better In way less time (less than 8+ weeks). End of May. Woot! It all depends on your life situation. Like do you have to work? Can you sit around and feel like garbage. Etc.  I have friends who tapered suboxone and had minimal withdrawals (but they took 6+ months to taper) and also were working hard recovery (connected to people, IOP or meetings, therapy, exercise, etc.)  it was just physically yucky (insomnia, cold, the usual) - but mentally they were GREAT. I know people who tapered subs and regretted even using it to begin with. And suffered. The better question to ask is. Were you on opiates prior to suboxone? If so - how much and how long?  Whats life like - parenting? Lots of work? Stress? Or could you be a slug for a bit?  Suboxone is a funny drug. Either a nightmare- or a miracle to get off of. Im not a doctor. I also never used subs to get off opiates. The one time I did (over a decade ago) I felt like it just prolonged the inevitable. But!!! I have a high pain tolerance - and always handled CT withdrawal like a boss. (Never wanna do it again though).  I think sub is a great tool for some people (and used as a taper tool,  not maintenance.)  - my ex husband turned into a different person on it- a shell of a person.  Also- the less war stories you read online the better. Next thing you know youre inventing symptoms - anxious over whether youre anxious about being anxious etc. So In conclusion LOL - what was your opiate habit like before? And what kind of life ya got going on in the next month. And hey! Getting off all that shit is an amazing decision regardless of how you do it- you will get off it. It will be worth it and you will be free. So - its win win no matter what.

"I'm an addict and I could never imagine treating my parents like this.  If I didn't have the money to get high, then I suffered.  Bills always came first and I always had employment that I showed up to daily and did my job well to fund my habit. If he isn't working and able to sit at home all day and cause destruction, it sounds like you are bank rolling his habit.  That has to stop immediately. He wants to get high? Go get a job and fund it yourself.  He comes up with the excuse he can't get a job because he would fail a drug test? Then he better take his suboxone so he can pass a test.  He is very obviously comfortable with his situation and you need to make him uncomfortable.   You have to set ground rules and now.  He has to gain employment, he needs to get on maintenance meds, he needs to go to meetings or see a therapist that specializes in substance abuse.  He needs to save up and move out.  If he can't follow your ground rules, you have to kick him out.     My parents weren't even funding my life when they found out I was using.  The only thing they were paying for was my car insurance and registration.  The second they found out I was using they dropped that on me and went no contact for like a year.  I stayed sober on suboxone when my family found out I was using, but sadly I tapered off my subs after a year and went right back to using.  I didn't want to be sober, it was a forced thing but I did it.  I used occasionally for years until I went back to daily use and realized I had gotten myself right back in the same spot as 10 years ago.  I'm older now and I was so tired of throwing my money at drugs.  I went back on suboxone, but this time it was my choice and it was on my terms.  I knew what I needed to do in order to better my life and do recovery the right way. Sometimes it takes us addicts several times to try to get it right and it's something that we will battle with for years to come.  As a parent myself now and even going through addiction, I would not be enabling my kid.  I understand that the addict has to want it for themselves, but I'm not going to allow my son to live a cushy life with no responsibilities and be disrespectful to me.

" Ive been sober since August 1, 2021. Yeah I count MAT sober since I wasnt getting high. Been on 8mg strip of suboxone twice a day since the start of September. Now due to my doctor being a bitch and the place I go to messing up they are punishing me by taking me off suboxone. Two weeks ago I weened myself to just 4mg twice a day. I currently only have one and a half strips left (16mg).   Okay so, 8mg a day - split dosed, yeah?   How bad is withdrawals gonna suck? I went through a whole month of straight withdrawing the whole month of August unti I got on subs. I never wanted to be sick ever again and thought when the time came to get off subs that Id be tapered off properly by a doctor.   If you have 16mg left I would drop like this personally, Day 1: 4mg, split dose 2 and 2 Day 2: 4mg, ^ Day 3: 3mg  Day 4: 2mg Day 5: 1mg Day 6: 1mg  Im scared shitless of it tbh. Right now Im currently real life (not withdrawing) sick for the first time since January 2020 and I hate it! I cant shake this off! And its making me absolutely dread the thought of withdrawing. Especially cause now Im at the point where I have to save my last 3 4mg suboxone doses and use when absolutely necessary.   Yeah it'll be a bit brutal  My only knowledge of suboxone withdrawal comes from 2 friends who got off it, but they both had the complete opposite experience from eachother. Everything I see on reddit tells me that its the worst thing ever to come off of and its harder than dope.  It can be. Especially jumping like this  Im really dreading this, back when I overdosed on August 1 I ended up going into the ER and was in a comatose state for 9 days I think. I was in a medical detox cause I was abusing RC benzos along with 2grams of some fire fettydope and 140mg of methadone daily. I think I avoided the worst of the withdrawal during my coma but if still sucked cause in one day I went from those drugs to just 30mg of methadone once daily. They told me methadone wds are like the worst and incredibly dangerous. Fuck just because I was on mdone meant no rehab would accept me at the time. I feel like that dose just kept me in a state of constant wd because I was suffering for 20 days straight on that dose before I went ct for 4 days to get onto suboxone. That whole month was hell and I hope this suboxone withdrawal wont be near as bad.   Good luck! I'm gonna msg u  Also is it withdraw or withdrawal?

The reason you are going through this is because you are at a crucial point in your taper and you're healing.  What dose are you looking to jump off from or are you going to try taking it all the way down to nothing?  The problem with suboxone is it has such a long half life that taking 0.8mg still takes like a week to eradicate the body so what you're feeling now is the detox of subs you were taking earlier.  As you continue into your taper, it allows more time for these doses to be detoxed from the body while achieving a new normal with the tapered dose by pruning the receptors that aren't being stimulated sufficiently by the dose, this is the reason for the anguish.

I had the same problem with suboxone I can send you some micro induction schedules you just start with 0.25 mg of subs the first day then .25 twice next day and gradually your opiod receptors will start to be occupied by suboxone due to its high affinity and eventually you make your way up to 12-16 mg trust me its way better then traditional induction methods you dont have to deal with the excruciating precipitated withdrawals that happen due to fentadope if you do it this way let me know if you need any help with the scheduling as I went through the same thing and this information was a life changer for me. With this strategy you keep using your full agonist fentadope until you reach 12-16 mg of suboxone then you stop all use because by then the suboxone will be occupying like 85% of your receptors so using wont even do much. ,2022-03-01T22:11:06+00:00,"suboxone, subs, suboxone, fentadope, fentadope, suboxone, suboxone",
What did they say that this goes against. It sounded like they also warned to wait awhile.  If you want to get on suboxone because you have an addiction go for it. It helps with cravings if your mainly physically addicted subs will just make this much much worse. When I was taking 8mg of suboxone I would sometimes relapse and would need like 100-300mg of oxy to get high again. And like not really even that high just to feel nice. Suboxone is a confusing drug for many reasons. The naloxone every doctor is told to believe is what prevents people from using other drugs to get high but thats not true bupe is the partial agonist that binds so tightly it prevents other drugs from being able to get in there. It also causes the pwd.  I ended up needing to go to rehab to finally get off of suboxone it was just too difficult for me. No matter how much I split my dose its still such a strong drug. Thats why its huge in jails. Someone can sneak in a 8mg strip and it can get 16 people high.

In the same line of thinking, once im not taking bupe, id like to try not using cannabis as well. Just want to see whatll happen, what it feels like. I know alot of people have had good experiences with viv, so ill he happy to learn more about it.  Also semi major work change coming next week. I work in a facility that does short term rehab as well as long term care. So we rotate between the two buildings every 6 months. Ive been in the LTC side since september. Theres 4 of us and it turned into almost like a little detachment apart from the rest of the department. Its been great to work so closely with the rest of our little group, and ive gotten to know people ive worked with for years, but didnt really know. So we go back to the main group next week. Its kind of a big change, but its also still the same job and facility. We've gotten into a comfortable little rut, so a little change will be good, however uncomfortable it may be.  Hope everyones well, hang in there if youre struggling. You can build a life for yourself thats fulfilling without drugs. Its so much work, but its worth it and it is possible.  Oh also, my old friend Pajamas, we were essentially inseperable between like 17 and 22, but i havent seen much of him in the dozen years since. Anyway, i guess he is home from rehab, and i just really hope for him that he can sustain sobriety. It made me so sad when our friend said he saw P and he was using and everything was looking so bad. P was like our slightly younger brother, we took him onto our paintball team and made sure he graduated from high school. Hes an ACOA, and i just hope so much that he can have a decent stable life.

You could try MATs like suboxone, but I recommend something that doesnt have an agonist in it like vivitrol. It kinda curbs the cravings (which are very intense because we start to grieve the loss of our DOC.) and at least with vivitrol if you try and use you wont feel anything (except guilt) try and do things that will help you start producing dopamine naturally.

Another thing Im not gonna do is neglect my hobbies and shit.  Before I relapsed, I LOVED playing poker.  Eventually I got burnt out from it and stopped playing.  I think that not having a passion for myself really bit me in the ass this time.

If you've got them to hand, you'll probably end up using more than your allocation eventually (as you've just done, understandably). You eventually have to go through some level of withdrawal anyway and it can never be completely pain-free. Probably the best thing is to cut off the prospect of any further supply, try and take as few as possible each day until you run out, then face the withdrawal. It's over in a few days and then you can get on with the rest of your life. Get support from other people: friends, family, medical, addiction support groups etc. ",2022-03-21T16:49:59+00:00,subs,

" i'm actually not sleeping because of it, i feel weird all day, drained,tired, then awake and okay, my body is all over the place.   I stopped completely for a day and i felt weird, jittery and restless  All of this is expected and exactly what all of us here experience, It CAN and WILL eventually pass if you get sober. You can 100% get your life back.  I can do this on my own, i know i can and i need to do it alone for myown mental health to prove to myself i can self discipline my mind.  Now please be very careful with this mindset. More often than not, going to therapy and getting sober on subs or other medical assistance is much harder work, requires a lot of patience and determination. It requires commitment to long term change and thats something we're all running away from. Detoxing on your own can be done, but you will most probably need support of a professional sooner or later. Remember that drugs are only a symptom, thats probably one of the most important things ive found out about this sickness so far. They're merely a symptom of a bigger problem, and as long as you avoid tackling that problem, you will be at risk of relapse and great distress. You do not have to do this alone and you should not hold yourself up to that dangerous ""standard"" because it can end up bad, and, again, does not prove anything. What matters is not your physical ability to survive the withdrawal in this very moment, what matters is that you want a deep change in your coping mechanisms and having a real, long term plan for who you want to be. Sorry for this long rant, i just feel strongly about this particular problem because i can relate a lot to beating myself up about proving something to myself, showing ""discipline"" via quitting cold turkey and such. Please remember - real discipline shows over the years, not over a few days of withdrawals. Check rehab clinics and addiction therapists in your area. Trust me they've seen and heard it all. A doctor that has actual experience with addicts and knows how the specific drugs work is so, so important to recovery. I tried it with a regular psychiatrist and it was so bad i almost gave up. If they havent professionally dealt with addicts they will only waste your time. ",2022-03-30T14:27:28+00:00,subs,"tired, jittery, restless, sickness"

"Lol, I had no idea it was called the pelican state. Im in the ocean state AKA the smallest state in the country and the hotline is awesome. Thirty minutes on the phone and subs are ready for pickup in an hour. Ive never tried liquid Ativan. Well, in an IV I guess I have. Regular Ativan tastes fine, minty like most benzos. I used mostly research chemical benzos during the kick and it definitely has alcohol and idk what else in there but one of the doses I puked and forced myself to swallow it back down lol no wasted doses. My trick is really to just mix it with something that masks the taste well and down it like a shot. And as far as subs go theyre a great detox drug. You can take your misery down from a 10 to a 5 doing a rapid taper before jumping off. Its worth considering and its not maintenance. Ive managed to do that and follow that up with a kratom taper and have zero withdrawals. Just like getting launched into PAWS.

"I've only ever had to CT for 5 days to get on subs. You can always attempt and have a backup dose if things go sideways. You should give that to someone you trust and only use it if necessary. Black tar should work if it's not laced. You could probably only wait 24 hrs but you should use the COWS scale to be sure. Even if you wait 72 and go into PW and need to use once to get out, you don't have to wait another full 3 days. Usually you can induct 24-36 hours after the second time and be fine.

Idk but it sounds like thats just another addiction to get over an addiction and that is what I'm trying to avoid, I'm not afraid of the WDs, this isn't my first rodeo, I've cold turkey before and yea I did relapse I wasn't ready to quit either, if I was at the point where I didn't think I could handle this by myself or was afraid that the physical withdrawals would be hazardous to my health then yea I would go get medical help but I don't need it. Before I was full blown addicted to H I wasn't an active drug user so to have myself where I'm physically dependent on a fkn drug is ruining me mentally more than whatever the fkn detox is going to be so yea in that aspect I'm pretty sure I got this thanks for wishing me luck I appreciate that and maybe don't try to be so negative to people whether you believe they will succeed or not, keep your doubt to yourself cuz  that shit can really be the turning point for a person having doubts or looking for a reason out, don't be  that reason to lose the hope they had...

"You might be taking too much and I know a lot of people overlap with their DOC while increasing. I started this today, from PST to subs, and so far:  4 AM .25 mg 6 AM 1 1/2 cup PST (half a cup less than normal) 10 AM 1 cup PST It is now 4:42 and mostly fine though by now on this current shitty batch I would have had dosed again at least once. I'd been tapering the tea already for weeks and so been in a near constant state of mild WD between doses until I added the sub.  The Bernese method, from what I know, always starts with the tiniest dose plus your DOC, the increases one and decreases the other. So it would look like this:  DAY 1 - .25 mg twice, DOC as normal DAY 2 - .5 mg twice, DOC as normal or slightly less DAY 3 - 1 mg twice, 25% less DOC DAY 4 - 2 mg twice, 25% less DOC Etc. By one week you should be off your DOC, stable on subs and at whatever level of those you need, which I have heard is all over the place. Some people say they do a bigger dose of subs mid week the go back down. Some say they just make it to 2 mg to 4 mg and stay there. I think the highest I've seen on an actual addiction doc schedule is 12 mg by the end of the week, but that's probably higher than most need.  It sounds l Iike you're taking too much plus not overlapping to give it time to get on the receptor as you stop using. People do a sorts of methods and some people do more and take some every few hours. But that seems to have a way higher risk of PWD than the alternative I mentioned above.  I'm going to be taking my second dose soon instead of the PST and seeing how I do. Which would be half my usual dose lately and with fewer WD issues than when I'm just on the tea with the current quality of seeds I have. And PST is no joke; insane half life, 50 alkaloids to WD from, and an average of 96 hours of abstinence to do a full, traditional induction using any other method.

"You're probably still feeling some withdrawal from the subs. Sub withdrawal did the exact same thing to me: I caved and used oxys. It genuinely was the most depressed I've ever been, and it sucks.  It takes some time to feel ""normal"" again. Your brain quite literally has to rewire itself. But it happens. I was on ~800mg/day of oxy when I finally quit. It took a good 2 years to feel like I'm completely on the other side of it.  But that doesn't mean it will all be miserable. Watch a funny old South Park or something and let yourself giggle at it. Blast music in the car and scream out the words (allow me to recommend Dead & Bloated by STP as the ultimate song for this). And so on. You can still enjoy things, you just have to power through it.  The best advice I can give is that you just have to resign yourself to the process. Certain things will get better relatively quickly (like being able to sleep). Other things will crop up later (the inevitable boredom, user dreams). But you can get through them. And, eventually, your brain will literally rewire itself.

I agree to an extent. For MAT and subs your delaying the inevitable. Subs by far should be banned. My withdrawl from subs kept me up for 42 days straight. Which I didnt even know that was possible. I do favor the MAT side but theres just so much bullshit that comes with it and I always tried to abuse the fuck out of it. Yes withdrawls are the worst. No I would never wish it for my worst enemy. It just depends on youre definition of sober and what you want. MAT is not sobriety and I dont mean to offend anyone by that.

"After you get used to they the subs won't get you high, but they will level you out and reduce cravings. buprenorphine is a mixed agonist and antagonist of your opioid receptors so it blocks other opioids from working if you were to take them. It gets you off the dope or whatever you're doing without withdrawal and keeps you off the stuff. You would have to skip your sub dose for 3 days or so before opioids start having any effect at all. Then when you are mentally ready to get off of it you can. It is also a guaranteed supply, unadulterated, and controlled by a doctor so it is much safer than buying opioids on the street. It is likely the only thing that saves the lives of many addicts who feel hopeless and with no way out. Subs give you the light at the end of the tunnel and allow you to improve your life without worrying about getting your next fix. Another good thing is they have a ceiling effect at about 24mg where it blankets all of your opioid receptors without having the possibility of a more acute effect.

For sure.  NJ need to suffer. I tried to do subs that is what I did the first time got them on the street this time I got a doctor and I put my self in a coma for 2 days off edibles butbi was doing fet sk wanted to go 3 full days plus to not get that crazy withdraw I read about taking sub to soon and I could but I called it quits that weekend and when I could not get on subs that next day Monday morning went to the clinic. Some people like myself and plenty bothers can't be sick for more than a weekend and even that is tough because of having to work 3 jobs to get by as an independent person  and bills stacked tj the ceiling due to whatever reasons kids pets credit cards cause of whatever.. and doing a MAT program saved me.  I told the doctors that I want to get off drugs but I don't want to lose my life doing it and fancy rehab and detox centers and all that are not in my cards amd doing solo laying on floor shitting and puking for a month doesn't qork either. If I do work I got NJ fall back no where to go no help. Some people we just got no support no one NJ help so that was my biggest thing and whybi used for so long. MAT program saved me.  I still got to continue my taper and get if it but I never wanted drugs so now it's super easy to never even think about it. Would be nice to relax especially on days with back pain from work but whatever live you learn but the important thing is that your getting better and just stay on the right track.

"Morning y'all. I was thinking this morning that I really need to go a little harder on tapering off my subs. To be fair, I started at a whopping 24mg just under 3 years ago when I first kicked (the fentadope in my city at the time was wiiiild in terms of wds, and I'd used subs so many times before in failed attempts to quit that they almost like stopped working for me), tapered off of that pretty quickly to 16mg, and am now on 8mg. But I know that, because of the ceiling affect, it doesn't really start to get difficult until you go under like ~6mg.   I'm not like beating myself up for being on them- they don't make me feel fucked up in any way shape or form and haven't since I first got on them and stuck to it, so I still consider myself clean ofc- but I'm getting to the point where I don't like the fact that a. I have to rely on any type of substance to feel normal and b. Am still on something that's directly connected to my years spent actively using, and that there's still ""dopesickness"" (it wouldn't be from dope, but idk what else to call it) ahead in my future.   Obv I plan on tapering down to like half a MG then jumping off, and everyone's different when it comes to how much it affects them, but I'm also pretty sure that, like dope, the longer you're on it the worse getting off will be. I was strung out for 3 years straight, but a lil over 5 years total of my life, and I've been on subs for just under 3 years. I've heard from various sources that you're supposed to stay on them for however long you were strung out for, but idk how true that really is (say if you were strung out for 15 years straight then sure maybe being on subs for like 7 years is necessary for some ppl in that position, but 15 years? Oof nah I feel like the negatives would outweigh the positives at that point).   And also, just like when the rona began and I was worrying that it might be the start of an actual collapse of society and the mad max style apocalypse, there's a tiny, maybe slightly irrational part of me that has a small worry in the same vein, except this time it's the potential of ww3 instead of the Corona (man, we really hit a home run being born in the generations of young gen x/millennial/older zoomer, didn't we ). I've got a decent stock pile of subs, but if worst comes to worst and things really end up devolving into shit in the next 5 years I do not want to be actively physically dependent on any substance.   I dunno man. I try to just live my life; to focus on the things in front of me and the things I can control, but sometimes it's hard. Luckily I'm able to keep a pretty good attitude about things and usually just cynically laugh about the fact that our current iteration of the world is indeed ending- like I'm lucky to not really suffer from any significant anxiety or depression over this shit, and can usually serenity prayer myself out of any situations where my mind may be running a lil wild (like yknow, reminding myself I can only control what I can control and that I have to deal with the things I cannot the best I can), but that doesn't mean it's not still kinda scary.   Well I gotta get going this was very long  no surprises there lol. I don't even wanna get into all the annoying bs at work rn but man that shit stressing me out too. I hope everyone is doing alright and if anyone's reading this who has tapered off subs successfully and has any words of advice I'd be really grateful to hear it.

"Please do everything you can to get clean, man. If you still love your s/o and want to be with them, you do NOT want to fuck your relationship up due to pills. It will make things infinitely worse and so so so much harder to quit for a long time. Hell, even if you're not sure if you want to be with them anymore... You're generally not thinking clearly because your feelings get dulled with this shit. I was having problems with the love of my life at a time where I was frequently using subs, and at the time it was easy to be like ""oh well, fuck it"" and not care. Well, once I got off them the damage had been done, and it hurt horribly and turned out I really did care a lot, and I went through the darkest period of my life. My advice is to either go to rehab, or try switching to kratom with the intent of tapering off the kratom. Kratom is pure plant matter and has very mild opioid qualities. If you're opioid tolerant, it will basically stave off withdrawal, not give you a high. Also, exercise exercise exercise. Seriously, it can be soooo difficult to start at first, but it absolutely makes a huge difference. I am so much happier on days I get good exercise in. It's so tempting to be lazy and lie around all day, and sometimes I do that, but I am noticeably not as happy when I do that. Make a list of things you want to do in life and things you love and care about, and keep it close. Read it for motivation to get and stay clean, because you can go ahead and assume you will definitely lose those things to opiates if you don't. Finally, the money. Fuck me, the money. I wasted SO much, it makes me sick, and I'm not even a very money motivated person. Quitting opiates allowed me to save up more than I ever imagined without even trying. I'll put it this way... I literally haven't looked at my bank account in a few months lol.

"Just want to chime in and agree. I would rarely advise subs for kratom, having dealt with being stuck on both my experience has led me to feel like subs for kratom is a terrible move. The only person I've ever advised to do it is my buddy who has experience with subs and their whole can of worms. It worked out for him. He was trying to taper for a month with absolutely 0 success and was sitting around with subs in his house because he also felt like they are complete overkill. Once I cosigned the decision (he wanted to do it, but was afraid he was deluding himself) 6 mg of sub over the course of a few days, good to go.   $100 worth of extracts a day is no joke. I'd rather kick a small dope habit twice than try to do that. I know opiod withdrawal, I can manage that. Kratom withdrawal has a bunch of other elements that break me, and I've never had a daily habit even close to OP's.  Moving to subs for a SHORT taper will allow you to get all of those other alkaloids out of your system while still having some relief from the opiod factor of the kratom.  I've been doing the opiate dance for the past 12 years now (with some good sobriety here and there). I've kicked them all. Kratom gives me more trouble than any other substance. I may be able to keep the dose at a measly 2 grams a day, so I'm barely even physically dependent.. and I STILL can't make that final jump and leave it alone for good! I got a little long winded here, but my main intention is to validate you, OP. Kratom is often treated flippantly and not taken seriously in the shadow of fent and heroin, but it is a powerful plant. It took me a while before I realized I had to treat my personal predicament the same way I approach being stuck on dope, even though the impact on my life is barely comparable. It's still that same energy.  Leaving kratom behind requires a recovery mindset, for me at least. Which can get sticky because most people will look at kratom as if you are already clean or something.  At your dose I would personally go detox in a behavioral health unit, or regular detox. They would do a quick sub taper with gabapentin and clonidine and it would likely be quite the 'easy' kick, relatively speaking. It's so much easier to just check out for 5 days, but I understand that is not an option for everyone.  I apologize for rambling on. I'm also trying to let go of all crutches and it's been helpful to get out of my head for a few minutes. I found a bag of dope on the ground at 711 yesterday and it threw me for a loop, tossed it, but ended up taking 7x the amount of kratom i take daily. Even at these low doses this shit has an impact, as I experienced rebound anxiety this morning.  I hope the best for you. Feel free to reach out if you'd like. The isolation is crippling. We need one another. Much love to you my friend. Edit: just peeped the comments. It seems like my experience is actually pretty typical. I always call kratom the 'final boss of opiate addiction'. Sounds like many of y'all can relate. I have a deep respect and appreciation for the leaf as it has added a degree of depth to my understanding of my substance abuse, but it's really nice to see people talking about it more realistically. It can get nasty. I also just re-read your post and saw that you are engaging in self-harm. Brother, get that week off and go to psych. You've been working hard at building a life for yourself and you deserve to love yourself. You have nothing to be ashamed of. This stuff will have you behaving in ways you barely recognize, as you already know. It's dangerous for people like us, with these specific issues, to be attempting this alone. I may just be a random stranger on the internet, but I genuinely care for your wellbeing.  In my experience, when I am unable to be present in my life and am lost in the suffering, it becomes next to impossible for me to 'see the forest for the trees', if you will. I've learned there comes a point where I must surrender my will. When I reach my surrender point I look toward someone who I can relate to, a trusted teacher or loved one. I do my best to try it their way, even if it is scary or seems like it isn't the path for me. The advice is always the same, too. Accept help. Let go of my model of how I expect things to be. Make my physical, emotional, and spiritual well being the absolute top priority in my life.  It sounds like similar advice is being parroted through the post. Medical assistance, subs. If it's even remotely possible for you I think it would be highly beneficial to check into psych. Your safety is a top priority. Plus, being in that environment is ultimately beneficial (as long as you don't let them push psych meds) in every way.  You deserve stability. The cycle of isolation makes this infinitely harder. Checking in somewhere briefly breaks that cycle immediately, and allows me to 'see the forest for the trees '. If you happened to read all of this just know you've got some dude rooting for you. You are worth whatever it takes.

"Short, two week long tapers outside a clinic? Didn't work long term for me. My friend on the other hand went into a clinic and has been on 8mg subs for a while now. He's doing really well. I went the methadone route and it was the best decision of my life. Stabilized, I got my life back. I would not have gotten clean without going there. The routine helped early on as well. Almost two months off and I'm doing really well.  Suboxone withdrawal is different and I can't speak on that, but what's better if you aren't able to stay sober after cold turkey? Using and continuing to fuck your life up or being on maintenance medication? I'll take the risk of being on something for life over going back to my old ways without question.

I'm getting a promotion after finally looking for a new job. I hang out with family. I clean my house. I would not have been at this point if I didn't get into treatment. I'd probably be dead.

"I totally understand the position you are in. It sounds like you need to try getting some comfort meds and either subs or go on methadone. Obviously methadone would be more time consuming because you'd have to go to the clinic every day, and with 2 kids that might not be feasible. I went every day with a baby but that would be so much harder with 2 toddlers unless you literally went at 5am every day when they're sleeping... So, since your husband is not going to be of any help, and you really cannot force him (sorry, sounds like he sucks)-- I highly suggest trying subs. Try to get some comfort meds too because it'll make it a hell of a lot easier. And I normally don't suggest benzos but if you have a way to get a script, it might be worth it for a few years honestly. Because anxiety and depression really suck coming off opiates. If you think your addictive personality would cause you to abuse them though, maybe try and just get some for a couple weeks. Subs seem like your only option right now, or at least the most realistic option. If you are not on fent/heroin, the transition really isn't hard at all. You only have to wait like 24 hours. Maybe even less. What dose of what meds are you currently on? Do you have a script? You could do a 2 week sub taper, but as a mother of just 1 toddler (2.5yo boy) it is really hard to detox without help, even with subs. Maintenance might be a good plan for you right now. It takes away a lot of the stress. But of course you could do a 1 or 2 week detox if you needed to. And your husband could at the very least help take over at nights if you need to rest sometimes. I'm so sorry he can't help you out more, and that you don't have family around to help either.

"in order to not get hooked on the subs, youve got to wait until the wds are really unbearable before inducing, and then take the absolute smallest amount of sub possible to just feel ok. then you gotta try to taper off that dose as quickly as possible, preferably in like 5 days, and never go above that initial dose.  and when youre taking the subs you gotta remind yourself that youre not using them to feel good or get high, only to not be sick. once you start chasing that feel good feeling like any other opiate its really easy for subs to just replace that addiction.

Eventually one thing lead to another, I ran out, I was in horrible withdrawal, puking, diarrhea, I felt like I was going to die, that was my breaking point. If you can get to a doc and get subs without anyone knowing, let yourself get sick for a little bit and then play it off like you have the flu or something, then take the sub (do this to avoids precipitated withdrawal), do a rapid taper off the subs over the course of about a week, then MAYBE that would work if you really really trust yourself not to use again after that point. But you have to be REALLY strong because the cravings will be really strong also. It more than likely wont work because most people give into the cravings and tell themselves, ""I'll just use this ONE time!"" and then that turns into everyday use. But if you are really determined to quit and you are in the right mindset then it can work. If you don't want to quit but you feel like you HAVE to quit, then staying on subs longer is a better option.

Sounds like he is taking great care of you!  It is pretty heavy but thats okayyou dont have to take what you dont need. Once you get on the subs you shouldnt need much if any of that anyway.  My only recommendation that differs would be to start the subs based on your COWS score and not based on the amount of time since last use.  If you are using actual heroin his time frame is about right. If it has fentanyl you must be careful to avoid precipitated withdrawals. The COWS score will work regardless of the opioid you are coming off of. You can google it and there is even a calculator to punch in your responses and get your score.  It is recommended to have a COWS score of at least 12 prior to suboxone induction and most recommend 15+ for fentanyl.   Good luck!!!

I actually rejected subs the first time I met my addiction MD, against their advice lol. I was begging them a few days later to give me anything, and omg did it make it do-able.  I had the mindset from the begging that I don't want to feel euphoria from another opioid(subs) since I'm trying to kick heroin, bc I know sub addiction is real. So I tapered myself to as little as possible. MD said as long as you don't feel withdrawal, your receptors are healing.  I could have gotten off subs after 8 months, but I had a bunch of life shit hit me that I knew I needed to stay on longer to prevent a relapse.  I wouldn't be scared of taking subs at all, especially if your withdrawals are terrible. Even if you decided to take 1000mg, suboxone has a ceiling effect, so you can't really get high or OD.

If you do feel worse after taking the sub you can use your gear (wait about 30 minutes). It should make you feel better and you have then started the Bernese method.  Then continue to take sub 0.5mg and use your gear after aBout 30 minutes. Work your way up on subs and down on gear.   If you need it I. An give you detailsI dont think you are going to need it.  I really think you are fine to take the subs full dose.but PWD make the most reckless of us err on the side of caution!  Just be realistic about your expectations from the subs.

If you don't have supportive people in your life who can be your support group, I would really recommend finding some. Some people find this through NA, AA, or wherever it is. Personally, my family is my support group along with a few friends who don't use. When you end up eventually trying to get off subs you got communicate with everybody because it might be really difficult for you (or it might not, everyone is different. At the end of the day though suboxone is still an addictive drug so getting off of it can be a hard time so make sure you talk it through with your family and friends) Anyways, I think you're on the right path dude.

You take subs after 24 hours of wd starting. Take enough subs where you still feel pain but its manageable. Then taper off that initial amount.

When I tried that I had a fet habit. I weigh like 130. Waited 2 days and took .5 and then .5 30min after. Didn't feel wd worsen or get any better. If you have high tolerance and have been using fet for a while I really wouldn't try it. If u stick precip out tho I think you can take the subs when thats over and they will comfort u. You should just watch tv shows and be awake pacing around for a like 4 maybe 5 days take the subs late at night when you feel like your completely in withdrawal and can't take it anymore. My fet wd(used for 6 month straight) wasn't so long but it did suck but your probably freaking yourself out more than you think. Precip sucks I hear. Good luck dude.

"Yea but him getting them off the street is somewhat still living that life. He could definitely go to a dr and ask to be prescribed the same amount hes been taking. Hes running the risk of not being able to get it one day and getting sick. Just let him know your there for him and you want to be apart of his journey and support him. But getting subs off the street I personally wouldnt be ok with unless there was really no alternative. ALSO I used to buy subs when I couldnt get pills, and take a very small amount till I could get pills again. So as a addict speaking to you thats also a possibility so just watch for signs of use. But most likely hes actively on subs and wants to stay clean. But Id push for the mat treatment thru a dr.

I did more research, I cannot out of pocket afford it and without getting into detail I am in the middle of a regional 7 plus figure lawsuit ( such a massive source of anxiety/stress, big reason I use ) that will absolutely use this against me, so attempting to get subs seems unobtainable currently.

Not going to lie, the half life on subs freaks me out. This will be the 3rd drug in less than a year I am getting off. The other 2 were non-abused scripts but still hard. 21 years on Seroquel.

Mostly for trauma related to my large case I previously mentioned. So if my depression gets really hard I have those options. As for 2, Im very worried once I feel better in a few weeks. I am very socially capable, I can always find and get what I want. I am worried Ill seek out more.

The only thing all of us addicts are trying to do when it comes to recovery is live a better life and not be so fucking miserable all the time and/or have so many problems because of our using.  Were just trying to be happy. Thats it bro.  So just be honest with yourself, and figure out if youre happy or not.  If the subs are working and keep working, then great. Stick to the plan you set out with your doctor and keep on keeping on. If the subs arent working or stop working, then youre gonna need to switch something up. What might that be? Idk. Theres a million different ways to people treat their addiction. Just pick one and if it works then great but if not go pick another one. Just make sure you give it an honest shot and dont ever stop trying.  The only advice I have to give about subs or methadone is that it should be a last resort. Because they are fucking hell coming off of, and you dont want to have to deal with that if you dont have to (along with paying for the meds, piss tests, clinic bullshit, worry about running out, etc). So I tell people that I try out other shit first.   But as far as whether or not being on subs mean youre clean or sober or what the fuck ever, I mean who cares man?

"Good news, OP. If you taper off the subs very slowly and methodically, and go down to a very low dose before jumping you won't be horribly sick at all. it can even be done while working. A person who HATES withdrawal sickness should never jump to zero from a dose of subs higher than 0.125 mg. Before going to 0, do at least a week to 10 days at 0.125 mg/day and a couple days at half that. If you want to know the schedule I used to taper off subs painlessly after 8 years of doing about 3 mg/day, please let me know and I will write it out for you. I stayed on the subs 8 years not because I was in danger of going back to street drugs but because I HATE to suffer and withdrawal is definitely one of the worst forms of suffering known to man. I was amazed and relieved to find my fears had been due to bad information and that tapering off subs was way smoother and less painful that getting off opioids any other way. (People also taper successfully off methadone for the same reason it's easy to taper off subs - both are very long acting so each cut is more gradual. But methadone is harder to obtain for most people.) You should know that 24-72 hours after you take a dose of subs, half that dose will still be active in your body.  I'm glad a nurse will be helping you. It is easy to cut bupe strips into tiny pieces with a razor blade. Pills can be crushed and divided into tiny lines of powder or dissolved and used volumetric tapering methods. All work very well. Just don't get impatient and jump from too high a dose and don't cut down any faster than you absolutely have to. You'll be amazed at how little you will suffer. Do a minimum of ""helper meds"" and concentrate on tapering slowly. I used 1 Imodium for diarrhea for a couple days and melatonin for sleep for about a week. I used a bit more caffeine during work and went to sleep early during the first few weeks. (I also used weed but I always use weed so it wasn't a part of my detox arsenal, just a regular part of life, like oxygen.) Anyway, I healed very quickly and it felt really good to be off the drugs. I also found I felt way better if I did 2 hours of exercise each day - which for me meant walking behind dogs on country lanes. If you taper slowly, you give your brain/body time to adjust gradually and you will not have to endure a major adjustment at the end.  Kratom is horrible and addictive. Don't do anything addictive.

"Yes you can, its not like subuxone. But dont waste it, take it when you feel the withdrawal symptoms completely. The first use can give you a high maybe, but the second time you wont feel any euphoria. You will just stop craving for more opiates and the best part is that you wont feel any symptoms. I will keep you updated about the wds tomorrow. Maybe i will feel a little discomfort but thats it from what I heard. If thats the case then I would suggest you to do it just like me. Dont take more than 20mg and quit after 5,6 days!  EDIT: and the effect lasts 24 hours. So you only have to take 1 pill each day! You wont wake up with symptoms, nothing.

I have never been addicted to anything but tobacco, but dependent on rX meds for years - now finally finished with those, if not the chronic pain that started it. But even just trying to taper from a relatively low dose has been unbelievably hard. Quitting smoking was crazy hard too. From what I know of fentanyl, I can't even fathom how hard that would be. Its like, with my meds, I am trying to hold my breath at the bottom of a swimming pool, while you have managed to hold yours at the bottom of the ocean, against currents and tides, for years. It truly is one hell of an accomplishment.  I think your therapist is right. You are here, you accomplished what you have, and you are soldiering thru your trauma each and every day. That gives you a very unique set of experiences, and an internal strength that is rare and only possible after tempering it from real personal struggle.  I am sorry about your blog being out of reach for whatever reason now, but I hope you keep writing. Keep sharing your story. Please. There are so many people going thru their own battles, and we all hear the horror stories, and sometimes the abbreviated success stories, but we don't often hear the real story from real people as they go thru it. I know without a doubt that I would have tried to find street drugs to fill the gap from my meds when they started the forced taper if I hadn't found places like this sub, where I could learn from others.

"Hey, how are you doing? I just found this post. I also had a problem with tramadol for a while, for legitimate chronic pain, like you. I have a genetic connective tissue disorder, have had 3 major reconstructive knee surgeries for a birth defect with a 4th coming up, and 10+ abdominal surgeries back in 2014-2015 for a rare type of abdominal cancer. The surgeries combined with the genetic condition will likely cause chronic pain for life. I'm 26. I was taking 10 tablets daily too. My doctor prescribes it, but I was feeling terrible at that dose. I don't know about you, but even though the medicine was helping and made me feel great in some ways, I noticed I wasn't ""myself"" in a way. I was getting upset and angry easily, I lost my appetite and my motivation and energy was decreasing. I was taking that dose for over a year before realizing I had to do something about it. In my case, I've stayed on it for the pain, but I've cut down to 5 tablets daily maximum, plus gabapentin 300mg twice daily. My head feels so much clearer. The pain is controlled, but obviously not gone. I still have pain, bit I'm able to live my life. If you can cut down on the dose and maybe add something for nerve pain (like gabapentin or Lyrica), it might be worth seeing if you can handle only taking 5-6 daily for the pain without needing excessive amounts, then possibly cut down even more if you want off opioids entirely. I was surprised that the pain is still controlled at this dose without the nasty side effects. If you want, I can share how I tapered down but this post is already very long. I was able to cut my dose in half over the course of 2 weeks without going through any major withdrawals. Anyway, hope you're doing okay.

It's not a super strong opiate, so it's relatively easier to get off of then more powerful ones like heroin or methadone. The down side is it does act on your serotonin as an SNRI so you might get depression in addition to the regular opiate withdrawals.

If I say something like ""she's a fuckin bitch"" and my counselor doesn't loosen their tie and speak in the same way, I won't be comfortable with them. Mirroring is a technique therapists use to make patients more comfortable. Mirroring tone, intonation, cursing, how you're sitting, etc. All of us use it to some extent but I know I work well with a therapist when they're able to comfortably say ""wow, that fucking sucks"". I need to be comfy and feel like I'm not out of place in order for me to actually absorb what I'm hearing and to be able to open up. I also cannot say ""GET A HOBBY"" enough.

It's relaxing, it gets you out of the house and soaking in that vitamin D, and you are interacting with other people that pass by or fishing with them.

I was very concerned about Kratom as well and only used 2-4g of red variant at night to help me sleep. During the day I would just deal with the WD symptoms. My anecdotal experience with Kratom is that it pauses WD. So the less you take, the quicker you can restart WD. For instance, when I took 4g at night, I wouldn't start feeling major WD until 6pm the next night. If I took 2g I would start feeling WD almost immediately after waking up. About a week in after taking Kratom at night I decided to take a hot bath followed by 10mg of valium which knocked me out. After that point, I never took kratom again.

My advice is see a hormone specialist, should be one in your area. Get blood work done and PLEASE message myself or I can set you up with my wife and can help you determine what they mean. We have spent years learning this stuff after doctors abandoned us and left us for shit after the main cancer treatment and surgery was completed. She felt like how you described, its no way to live. Were happy to offer help. Id be willing to bet a crisp 100 dollar bill your hormones or thyroid is low in value. Best of luck, let me know if I can help.

I know exactly one person crazy enough to use naltrexone in pill form well he used that shit for a year and he was depressed for a year, but there must be something what's an advantage using that stuff and if somebody could tell me a little more I would appreciate that, because I can't find what the advantage is, except for that using any opiate is useless so it prevents using is that the reason it's taken? I believe this vivitrol acts like a month or so or even longer and I just don't understand why this is taken voluntarily now trying naltrexone in pill form to find out how it is okay no problem, but getting such an implant therefore no opiate works so what to do is when you are stuck with such an implant and you need painrelief from an opiate after surgery or accident for example. That means no painrelief possible from an opiate. Funny that name vivitrol in Dutch we have a word written as vitriol and that's another literal word for poison.

"There are people that will judge but I think it will surprise you how few are. In my experience anyone that held it against me wasnt worth my time and being up front (first 3 dates) about it saved me from wasting my time with people that were t worth it. I found that the majority of women understand and dont care as long as you dont go back to it. The biggest thing is how much you are going to change in recovery regaining your self esteem, value and confidence in who you are. Due to this I was very successful dating in recovery and the quality of the people I was seeing steadily increased over the angry damaged women I felt I deserved while I was using.  I now have an amazing fianc that knows about my past and is open to talk about things when I still occasionally feel triggered 5 years in. She is far better than anyone I would have imagined would love me while I was using or in early recovery.  Do not listen to these people saying hide it or that there is a huge stigma about it.

"Id say the jumping is from your nervous system being out of whack. Hopefully in a couple of days that will ease.  I was gonna try to taper but I cant be trusted not to swallow the whole packet (wtf is wrong with me?!) weed definitely helped last night. A wave of relief came over me, a moment of introspection too. I had a good think about everything, why am I doing this? What am I numbing? Anywho I nodded off to sleep & it was a massive relief.  My usual reason for not smoking is because my brain does that- I go inside myself a bit too much & get too deep Im an uppers type gal so I dont even enjoy diazepam (they knock me clean out) but weed has been amazing for sleep & to take the edge off this past few days.  Im currently distracting myself with Netflix. My husband has been amazing to take care of the kids but I need to get it together ASAP because his work situation is about to ramp up & he wont be around to pick up the slack. Im happy for the rest today tho. I managed to work yesterday (on my feet for 9 hrs) and aside from the odd break out of the sweats I was fine. I explained to co-workers that my dr had adjusted regular meds Im on so if Im a bit off thats why. The biggest test was passing my usual pharmacies & not stopping so Im thankful for that.  Take each day at a time & do try the Imodium. Read the links I sent for the science behind it. As far as I know Imodium can be addictive so use it for the first couple of days. It acts like codiene in your intestines etc so I wonder if thats prolonging withdrawal? It helps anyway. The mega dosing of vitamin c, sodium powder type is recommended. Youd prob grab that in Holland and Barrett. Take it as directed & as much as you can tolerate, I dont have the stomach for massive doses so Im taking 1000mg 2x a day! Why its not more openly known about the benefits is infuriating. People are led to believe that methadone & subs are the only way to kick this.

"I dont mind at all. Thanks for asking. Im happy to share, especially if my doing so helps others.  Trauma was definitely part of why I started using drugs. I had a lot of shit happen to me as a kid, and Ive been struggling with chronic depression for as long as I can remember. Been seeing doctors and therapists from as young as 12. Abuse, neglect, life-threatening medical issues facing myself and my loved ones . I spent a lifetime being traumatized and repressing it. I was always sad. Always in pain. And then when I got older and found drugs, I finally experienced for a moment what it was like to have all of that  melt away. I found something to turn it all off. To make me happy, and forget about all of the bad things. It started with weed, and ended with fentanyl. I just kept needing more and more to numb myself. Stronger and stronger drugs to make the pain stop. And it worked, until it didnt. And then the drug use just made all of those other problems a million times worse.  Currently I am on antidepressants and mood stabilizers; these help treat my depression and bipolar 2 disorder, but they arent given specifically for cravings. Last year I was evaluated for and diagnosed with PTSD, and I was prescribed medical marijuana to help with those anxiety+panic symptoms. So I use marijuana pretty much daily. It helps with the PTSD, but it also does help a lot when I have cravings because I can still get high and kinda scratch that itch  but with something MUCH more safe and actually beneficial to my overall health. I think I would struggle a lot more without it.  My motivation was simply that fentanyl was ruining my life. I was so miserable. Constantly in physical and emotional agony. Constantly risking death, ruining relationships, ruining my life . I got so sick and tired of being sick and tired that my suffering finally outweighed my desire to keep getting high. It took years though  I relapsed countless times in my efforts to get clean. I did rehab. I did medical detox. I did cold turkey. Therapists, doctors, counselors, NA, AAI kept relapsing over and over until I finally didnt. And all of my failed attempts did ultimately teach me the lessons I needed to succeed, so Im grateful for all of them. But in the end the final piece I needed to get clean was my own internal desire to stop suffering.

I have been using weed and gapabentin, as well as Robaxacet, Atarax and the occasional Ativan for sleep that I was lucky to be gifted. I jumped off ~200-250mg/day oxy. Baths have been amazingly soothing. In the past, I have had great results from high dose vitamin C in the other states of withdrawal. It helped to give me some energy, and somewhat took the edge off somehow. I only took 20mg on Saturday, way below my usual, and that day I started the gabapentin. I also got royally drunk for the first time in ages, but thats a different story. Waking up, hungover, onto withdrawal is not something Id recommend to anyone. That was a bad plan but it also let me sort of float through Sunday, with the help of Gabapentin so I guess it wasnt a total fail lol. I hope your holding in there. Good luck and best wishes! I have never done the fent that is around, but I did do a week or two of Suboxone a bit ago, prior to my last little slip I felt like crap on it. My relapse covered the acutes of Sub, so I am not sure how much if any withdrawal I had from them hell, I might still have some residual effects this is only 2 weeks later.
