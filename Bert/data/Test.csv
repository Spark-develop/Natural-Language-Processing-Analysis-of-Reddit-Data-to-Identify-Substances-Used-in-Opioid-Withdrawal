0,"Hey man, sorry I'm just getting back to you. I have had sleep issues since I was around 13 years old anyway, but yes, I do find I have sleep issues while on subs lol. I don't know how related it is to the subs, because I have prescriptions for Remeron (Mirtazapine) for sleep, as well as Hydroxyzine which I may take 50-100mg of a night, or not take any at all. Generally I do take my remeron 45mg though. I still don't sleep great, and in general sleep in increments of 2-3 hours, rather than the proper increment of 6-8 hours.  While I was trying to sleep that first night on subs, I had this feeling where I could NOT finish my yawn. I had to yawn, I felt the yawn, but I couldn't finish so I just had my jaw wide open for like 2 minutes straight. I was so frustrated.  I googled something like ""cannot complete yawn suboxone reddit"" and remember seeing several threads with people complaining about sleep issues while on subs. Apparently the inability to complete yawns means there is something wrong with your nervous system. Which is not at all surprising, of course. I hope this helps :/ ",2022-03-18T13:29:09+00:00,CODEINE,depression,"Remeron,yawn,issues,yawn,subs,sleep","['Agonist', 'Anxiety Medication', 'Muscle Pain Medication', 'Muscle Pain Medication', 'Anxiety Medication', 'Anxiety Medication', 'Anxiety Medication']","CODEINE, depression",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Realize that your brain is going through changes, its healing! And healing hurts and it takes time. Get into exercise but be kind to yourself.

Find something to appreciate everyday, something you didnt have while you were on fent, and those good things will start piling up and youll feel better + your brain will be getting healthier everyday.

44,"Gabapentin actually absorbs less and less the higher the single dose goes. You have to titrate 3grams, aka take 600mg every 20 to 30 mins if you have no gabapentin tolerance. It legit is one of my favorite drugs after figuring that out, and also that fat also will increase absorption by a decent bit. Orally administered gabapentin exhibits saturable absorption  a nonlinear (zero-order) process  making its pharmacokinetics less predictable. Plasma concentrations of gabapentin do not increase proportionally with increasing dose. In contrast, orally administered pregabalin is absorbed more rapidly, with maximum plasma concentrations attained within 1 hour. Absorption is linear (first order), with plasma concentrations increasing proportionately with increasing dose. The absolute bioavailability of gabapentin drops from 60% to 33% as the dosage increases from 900 to 3600 mg/day, while the absolute bioavailability of pregabalin remains at <-90% irrespective ofthe dosage. Some people on bluelighjt seemed to confirm this anecdotally and as someone who is prescribed large amounts of gaba daily for years now it definitely is a noticeable difference titrating it. Last time I was in rehab the brain health specialist mentioned this without me prompting a question about it (he was going over pharmacokinetics and addiction) and it was kinda cool hearing it from an established doctor who was a recovering addict as well. For me doing 900 to 1200mg titration over the course of 2 or 3 hours produces a surprisingly speedy feeling in addition to providing restlessness relief, neuropathic pain, all then other things associated with the drug. Also this is a very small study on the fat absorption thing so take this, as scientific knowledge, w a grain of salt but again I've at least had the perception that this is true, albeit titration being more important imo  Data from all subjects were used for pharmacokinetic and safety analyses unless stated otherwise. Mean (standard deviation) bioavailability (based on urinary recovery) of gabapentin from gabapentin enacarbil was 42.0 (6.1)%(fasted), 64.3 (13.2)%(low-fat meal), 64.9 (16.9)%(moderate-fat meal), and 76.1 (14.4)%(high-fat meal). Gabapentin exposures (AUC (inf)) in fed conditions were 23%(low-fat meal), 31%(moderate-fat meal), and 40%(high-fat meal) greater than the exposure under fasted condition.

46,"That's a good question tbh. I'm usually fairly nice to myself these days, but sometimes I feel like I need to be meaner to myself otherwise I won't be ""tough"" anymore or some stupid bullshit like that. But I guess letting myself be sad about some shit that's an 11 year old problem (albeit a pretty big problem) is being nice to myself, kinda.   That problem would be my old homie who's been missing since may 2011. The first kid I ever met in the punk scene, back when he was 17 and I was 13. That was in 2008; its coming up on 14 years since I met him and my life changed forever. If it wasn't for meeting him (and him being my first kiss and me developing a HUGE crush on him, I should say, lol) I wouldn't have gotten into the punk scene, and through a long chain of events I maybe wouldn't have started doing dope (although I kinda doubt that, I think I would've ended up a junkie even if I did turn out ""normal"", it just might've taken a longer time idk). But I don't regret meeting him for a single second. I don't really regret any of my life, honestly, despite all the insanity and hell I've been through.   Anyways. Its grey and rainy outside, similar to the weather around the time I first met this kid. I always get weirdly nostalgic this time of year. Except this year, it'll be the 14th anniversary, and I was only 13 when all this happened. It's been longer since it happened than how long i was alive for at the time that it did. Which is wild. And speaking of long times, the longer someone's been missing for, the more the chances of finding them (not even alive, just finding them at all) Go down exponentially year after year.   It may seem silly, but sometimes I'll be out in the world and I'll see someone who looks similar to him and my mind will instantly jolt, then I'll look for his tattoos and realize it obviously isn't him. He did grow up right across the river from my city and had 7 siblings, so I could very well at times be seeing one of his little brothers. But they know as much about where he is as I do, if not even less.   I have extremely little hope for him being alive, of course. But I just wanna know. I just wanna know what happened to him. The older I get, the more the years of my life where he and the rest of the old punk kids crew was around for fades into rough edged memories. That's life, I guess. But something about this makes me so sad. I'm used to having friends who live on the fringes of society (and to doing so myself). But the older I get, the more I realize that this- having a good homie go missing without a fucking trace, and just NEVER be seen again or have any remains found after over a decade- is RARE,  even for a scene full of people who disappear in and out of society.   There's no way to end this post on a reasonably happy note, lol. But idk. These days, with this kind of grey rainy spring weather, always bring me back to being a kid in my home city, in this weird way. I'm glad I'm still friends w ppl who were with me during those times, 10-14 years ago, and can reminisce about them with me, but the more time goes on, the more homeboys existence fades into scraps of memories at the bottom of the filing cabinets in people's minds... and that makes me sad.

52,"I totally get that!! and while Im not a fan of the terminology, I do acknowledge that drugs are not for me. I was addicted to opiates after being prescribed them by my doctor. Unfortunately Ive needed opiates a few times since getting sober for post-surgical pain. Ive had to totally rework my relationship to opiates, because theyre occasionally a part of my reality.  I realized it was never about the drugs, it was about the pain and fear that led me to numb. The few surgeries Ive had in sobriety, I did not finished the post-op script or accept refills. Ive been able to take the medicine as prescribed, throw the extra away and move on.  Historically, Ive developed a maladaptive coping response to pain, and still having health issues, I need to acknowledge the potential slippery slope with medication. Im not in denial about my history of addiction, but that portion of my life does not define who I am.  I think words have power and I dont like to reduce myself to labels that no longer apply.  Labels are useful in term of coping, but sometimes theyre limiting. like for example its important to be able to name anxiety and panic attacks, because otherwise you think youre dying. But sometimes having the label of anxiety disorder can limit oneself. For example, in the past Ive said oh I cant do that. I have anxiety or Im just an anxious mess.  The anxiety label in those situations prevented me from doing things and self-actualizing. Who am I? Am I an addict? Am I anxious? No, who I am, at the core is pure essence. Simply: I AM. The rest of the labels that come after I AM are just reference points for the ego to position itself in the physical world, and create an identity to differentiate myself from others. Im not saying that I havent been addicted, or that I dont have anxiety, but theyre not who I am And theyre not labels that I want to reinforce who I am.

55,"I completely relate to this post. I used for over a decade and for the last 5+yrs of active addiction, there were SO many times I wanted to quit. But then I'd have a change of heart by the next day, and say I'd deal with it later. I got to the point where I thought I was gonna be using everyday until I finally overdosed and passed away. I genuinely thought I was a lost cause, and lost all hope in getting clean. Plus I had 20-30 failed attempts at getting clean in the past, so that didn't help my situation. But I had a major life change which pushed me to finally do it. I had my first child, when I thought I couldn't even have kids. That's when I got clean for good and it's been almost 3yrs now. There are plenty of days where I think, ""damn I wish I could get high right now"". But I know using one time would probably kill me, since I have no tolerance anymore and there's nothing but fent everywhere. And I can't bring myself to take the risk of leaving my children without a mother. It's crazy to know now that we can actually live day to day without getting high. I also quit all hard drugs when I quit using fent. Which I also never expected to do either, but it just happened. I also keep telling myself on my bad days.. ""if I made it this many days, then I can make it one more day."" And then the craving passes and I go back to normal afterwards. I just wanna say too, the hardest parts for me by farrrr were the first week and the first 30 days. So congrats on making it four weeks!! That's a really big deal & If it were easy, then everyone would be doing it. For me, it got easier as time went on. And my life is nothing like it used to be, which is great.

78,"Chick here.   Then X backtracked, saying men/women shouldn't lean on each other in that manner (X advised I find a sponsor of the same gender - I wasn't looking for a sponsor/a program, I just don't have anyone in my life who understands anything related to chronic pain/opiates).  Could be seen as him recognizing how vulnerable people are early in recovery and is setting boundaries to avoid the wretched step 13. Very easy to dive into sex and relationships early on while you are still figuring shit out which opens up risk for stress and instability in your life which, in turn, can fuck with your ability to cope with newfound sobriety (nasty break ups can lead to numbing the pain, trading opiate addiction for sex addiction because your brain is screaming for dopamine). Or it could be that he knows how it looks for sponsors to get too personal with their people, knows it's wrong ethically, and doesn't want that stigma if he makes a move. Can't tell ya which.  but X does share funny/interesting stories from their past when they were in active addiction (X has been sober for years).   Be careful with this. It's one thing to laugh about the past, but there is a fine line between a funny story and glorifying the lifestyle, ya know? I've been triggered multiple times by stuff like this. If this has any potential for triggering you, set boundaries now. Better to set the boundary than end up triggered and relapsing imo. I try and stay far away from any glorification of it. All of the stories I share include the downsides of my addiction. ""I'm glad I'm not in that situation and I am happy to be sober"" stories.  X is very supportive of my hobby & encourages me to stay busy, physically active etc.   Good trait and good advice.  Conversations have become more personal (X commenting on other classmates issues, pointing out their character flaws, X speaks highly of themselves/how they're trusted by the opposite gender etc).   das a no from me, dog. If it's a passing statement, I guess it's fine. If he is consistently talking about how he isn't a threat to women, fuck no. Only people I have met that talk like that are grimey. Good people don't need to do that. Good people also don't consistently talk shit about other addicts or other people in general. ""Look how great I am and how messed up everyone else is."" At the best, it's cocky. At the worst, it's projection and narcissism.   X hasn't done anything inappropriate- they haven't made a ""move"", no physical contact that wasn't appropriate to the situation, they don't message me about personal matters since creating the opposite gender boundary...  Green light.  X is significantly older (>20 yrs older), the opposite gender & in a long-term relationship. They've stated multiple times ""you can never fully trust addicts"", speaks openly about past relationships, & shared private details of their life (as have I).   Just keep in mind that there is definitely a potential ""power imbalance"" that can form here. He has a lot of sobriety time and he's a lot older than you. This is how step 13s happen. He's right about how you can't fully trust an addict. My go to joke is ""how can you tell if an addict is lying? Their mouth is moving."" It's lighthearted but unfortunately has truth behind it. Just because he is in a long term relationship doesn't mean that would stop him from pulling any bs. He better keep his hands to himself.  I feel as though we are friends but then there's also the strange imbalance when they make it clear they see me as a younger, inexperienced person who is at a vulnerable point in life. They emphasize their significant experience with addiction/manipulation while warning me away from trusting the wrong person so early after quitting.  Ding ding ding. Good advice. Again, could be that he is warning you about others or projecting. Can't tell you which side on that one either. At least you are paying attention and looking out for these things. Still know it is easy to brush off red flags when you finally have someone that ""gets it"". It's hard cutting off connection with people that we can relate to, so it's easy to make excuses for sus behavior.  In the last 6 months I've dealt with multiple deaths in my personal life, the end of my serious long-term relationship (unrelated to the opiates) and trying to figure out how to accept my pain while adjusting to who I am without oxy... It's a lot of change to my life and who I am in a relatively short time.  You are vulnerable. Please, please be careful. If you are making a post like this, you feel like you have a reason not to trust him. Listen to your gut. You need to focus on yourself. Do not let anyone get in the way of that by introducing stress into your life. Even if he just gets overbearing and doesn't make a move- bye bye. You have your own life to figure out, your own problems to solve.  Grief is complicated and messy in and of itself. I literally had a threesome the day I lost my house. Then I got in a poly relationship after my friend died. Do I regret it? No. He was a close friend we had already slept with. Was it something I expected to do in a tragic situation like that? No, not at all. Banging after losing everything and sleeping in a hotel? Again, grief is weird.  Is X just being a good friend and looking out for me? Is the advice genuine because they don't want me to end up getting 13th stepped?   Only you can really answer this, hun. But I gave my two cents. Be vigilant. Do not excuse worrisome behavior. Rose tinted glasses and all that. We want to believe that people have our best interests in mind, but sometimes that leads to people taking advantage of us.

80,"Yes 16mg is high - but youve only been on it 2 weeks. With a longer taper plan like this one (which is great - depending on your situation - but consider.) This means 5 weeks of staying on suboxone. Add another 2 weeks for when youre cold turkey, you will be fatigued whatever. So 8 weeks from now youd probably feel more new. By July/August youd be right as rain! Yay! If you cold turkey your two week usage- yeah itll suck balls . But I bet youd feel a lot better In way less time (less than 8+ weeks). End of May. Woot! It all depends on your life situation. Like do you have to work? Can you sit around and feel like garbage. Etc.  I have friends who tapered suboxone and had minimal withdrawals (but they took 6+ months to taper) and also were working hard recovery (connected to people, IOP or meetings, therapy, exercise, etc.)  it was just physically yucky (insomnia, cold, the usual) - but mentally they were GREAT. I know people who tapered subs and regretted even using it to begin with. And suffered. The better question to ask is. Were you on opiates prior to suboxone? If so - how much and how long?  Whats life like - parenting? Lots of work? Stress? Or could you be a slug for a bit?  Suboxone is a funny drug. Either a nightmare- or a miracle to get off of. Im not a doctor. I also never used subs to get off opiates. The one time I did (over a decade ago) I felt like it just prolonged the inevitable. But!!! I have a high pain tolerance - and always handled CT withdrawal like a boss. (Never wanna do it again though).  I think sub is a great tool for some people (and used as a taper tool,  not maintenance.)  - my ex husband turned into a different person on it- a shell of a person.  Also- the less war stories you read online the better.

Dealing with a loved ones addiction is horrible and difficult, and since I've had an ex and have a best friend w BPD, I'm somewhat familiar with it and I know that that must make it even harder. But you have 110% made the right decision here. I know how much it hurts to leave someone that you still love a lot, but when you end up losing your whole self to this person, that's when it's time to pack it up and go. I don't know you, but I know you have potential, skills, goals and hopes and dreams- and I'm pretty damn sure that just from what you wrote, having this man by your side and having to deal with his chaotic lifestyle is NOT conducive to you living the life you want, whatever that may be.   I know it must hurt right now. Don't beat yourself up for being upset- give yourself a few days to mourn the relationship. Take a bath with a bath bomb, order your favorite take out food, watch a movie that makes you happy cry. And after that, write out a list of all the things in your life that you'll now be able to do/not have to worry about, now that you're not devoting a decent amount of your mind to worrying/thinking about your ex and his addiction. If you need a reminder not to go back, take it from me- when people get off dope and jump straight to getting drunk all the time, the results are NEVER good, they often end up getting annoying and pathetic at best and abusive at worst, and you do not need that in your life homegirl.   You got this. Stay strong and stay away from him. I know its hard to watch someone you love make awful decisions but, like other commenter mentioned, sometimes you gotta put everything else aside and just look out for YOU.

You could try tyrosine which is a dopamine precursor in case your body isn't creating enough and Buproprion (Wellbutrin / Zyban) to help with that. It can even act as an adjunct medicine to typical SSRIs or atypical antidepressants as they act on different receptors. Alternatively psychedelics such as shrooms and disassociates specifically Ketamine are either being researched or actively available as new novel antidepressants (very expensive Spravato, Esketamine based nasal spray). They work quickly, promote neural development and with a bit of therapy can really help rewire the brain, unlike most antidepressant substances. Better yet, they are longer acting, with effects lasting a month / two months respectively. Of course if you are looking for none medicated options there's always rTMS which works far better than antidepressants in 60% if patients but requires daily sessions for a month. It has stimulates neural growth and connections iirc. it tends to help emotional blunting and motivation (dopamine) the most. Marry never require future treatment for depression, some require yearly or monthly top ups and some just need the occasional one off booster from time to time. If no meds or TMS work there's always ect (electroconvulsive therapy) which is much older and more serious but is mostly the same as TMS but with electricity rather than magnets. After that your nuclear option is vagus nerve stimulation which stimulates the vagus nerve at regular intervals and is apparently quite , effective (not sure percentage). But unless you can get the new external stimulation device it requires surgery and the effects can take six months to build up.

Time flies though, I remember you commenting on my initial check in posts 3 years ago when I was first tryna stick w being clean like it was only a few months ago. Hope you and the kid are doing well    So my work is opening back up again in a week from today, only for 3 days a week for now until the weather gets a lil nicer so it's not as stressful as it could be. I love my GM to death and at the end of the day will always be on his side cuz friends come before work; even if they're friends you met through work, but I worry about him dropping the ball on certain things and the higher ups getting pissed but him not being willing to reach out to me to help cuz he's worried about looking bad. I'm tryna not stress out about anything cuz I can only control what's within my control but yk its work so it's gonna be stressful at times.   I'm honestly happy to be back at work with some regularity- I really was losing my mind in January when I was fully wfh and then got covid. A part of me still feels a kind of weird stagnation, but I think that's only cuz I'm not used to living the same life for so long. I've been in this apt for 4 years and at this job for 3 years- until now I had only ever stayed in places /at jobs for a year max before flipping the table of my life and dipping out.   Anyway. Im tired and I really gotta order groceries today cuz I cleaned my entire kitchen top to bottom the other day (took me 6 hrs for a literally 50sf kitchen but it was worth it cuz now shit looks like I just moved in) but after cleaning out my fridge i realized I literally have no food and I've been so good about cooking and not getting outside food the last few months that I can't fuck it up now and start spending $100/wk on takeout (ah, the stupid shit we manage to spend money on once we get clean.. better than dope I guess lmfao).

Therapy group and community that revolve around psychedelic integration are really what is needed to figure out this tricky process in conjunction to ibogaine, but like u/wearythroway said the detox part is only the beginning and when people aren't properly prepped they go in thinking that is the only challenge and then fail when they come home.  we are programmed to treat things like this since birth in our society. take a pill, fix a problem. the problem isn't one thing though- it's everything!!!!

But it made me tired and foggy and I didnt realize how much it affected me until I got off. Detox from subs was much longer than it had ever been with actual narcotics. A lot of DRT docs make money off their patients and encourage people to stay on subs for longer than they need to. Its easy to get stuck, and the longer you wait, the harder the detox is. What worked for me as far as getting clear and healthy was 12 step. I think the best use of suboxone is temporary. Set a tight timeline, transition off of your DOC and then transition off of subs. Claim COVID to buy yourself some time off if you need to. Glad youre asking questions before making a choice.

233,"This! OP this is solid advice. Question. Have you ever been narcand, especially if it wasnt necessary like some idiot friend thought it would be funny or for whatever reason youre a stupid curious idiot like I am and thought it would be an interesting experiment to see what happened if he took Narcan because he never had it before? If youve experienced Narcan and you know what I mean about the withdrawal from that how quickly it comes on and how acutely painful it is Precipitated withdrawals are worse at least with Narcan it has a very short half-life and peaks at like 45 minutes to an hour after an hour and starts to wear off by two hours youre starting to feel maybe human again by three hours youre looking for your dope ready to get fixed ,  assuming you werent already frantically looking for it trying to counteract the Narcan. By four hours its worn off and hopefully you had some opiates in your system before you took it because if you did then they probably are still there a little bit and youre not feeling completely dope sick but my point is Narcan withdrawal is like half as bad as precipitated withdrawal in my opinion. Precipitated withdrawal also last so much longer and its so much more intense. Dont take Suboxone if youre just feeling a little bit with Raleigh take it only when youre moderate to heavily in withdrawal Ive had to re-induct three times over the past year the first two times were a breeze. The first of the three I had waited over 18 hours after taking fentanyl and I was in pretty severe withdrawal. The second time I was coming out of the hospital from surgery and Im a very low-dose of hydromorphone contin  6 mg I took in the morning.. right at the 12 hour mark I was crawling out of my skin from being in withdrawal for the past four days before that but having that little bit of opiate in the morning I dont know if it made me better or worse because I had to wait 12 hours before I could take the Suboxone but I was like partially opiated but not nearly enough. Anyways right at 12 hours I caved and heres the other part that is so important especially if your high-dose user is even more important but hard. Dont take more than 4 mg the first day. On the second day dont take more than 8 mg. Has another user posted more than 12 mg is kind of excessive. 28 mg tablets is in my opinion unnecessary. Suboxone is such a long acting opiate that it takes a little while to ramp it up in your system like two or three days but I can go easily 48 hours without taking my Suboxone before Im starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. I used to be on methadone and I could barely get to it 24 hour mark and I will be scheeving for my dose. The half-life of buprenorphine is something like 72 hours or something I dont know its crazy long. My recommendation would be to the way I did the first two times. Start off with just 1 mg. Cut a 2 mg tablet in half and take that and see if you feel worse. Youre not gonna feel better from it but the keys dont feel worse. If you dont feel worse after half an hour take another 1 mg. Again if you dont feel worse after half an hour take the other 2 mg tablet. And then call it a day. Hopefully you dont feel worse after that if you do you just got a ride it out. Suboxone blocks opiates so if you get tempted to take them your normal dose before its not gonna be the same dose again. I if you ever get to that point that youre so uncomfortable in the induction process that youre thinking of using please PM me or somebody here who has had experience with ducting multiple times and has experience with taking full opiate to counter act precipitated withdrawal. Regular withdrawal aint shit compared to precipitated withdrawal. If you get a little bit of a regular withdrawal thats fine its not comfortable but its nothing like precipitated withdrawal. I have serious trauma from that shit its not even funny. I said I had been inducted three times in the past year but I only talked about the first two because they went smoothly I got on the Suboxone no problem but the third time I waited about 12 maybe 13 hours I was in mild withdrawal and I start off of 1 mg didnt feel worse 2 mg didnt feel worse popped another full 2 mg so thats four total didnt feel worse but then I kept going for some stupid reason. I took half of an 8 mg so thats a total of 8 mg right there and I shouldve stopped there because I started to feel a little bit worse at that point but stupidly I didnt and I took the other 4 mg so thats 12 mg but something told me spit this shit out right now and think I did because it was already bad enough as it was I was in such bad precipitated withdrawal it hit me so hard when I thought that I was in the clear. I know now that was because youre not supposed to take more than 4 mg in the first day. Ive heard of some people taking eight and maybe that works if youre in like severe withdrawal but if youre in just moderate withdrawal dont take more than four. There is this alternative way of inducting I read about on  PubMed what are you dont have to go into withdrawal first. Its basically Microdosing induction.  Its also called the Bernese method after the Doctor Who figured this out. Heres a link : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970598/ Basically its for patients who cant tolerate withdrawal and do a normal induction and they ramp you up slowly over a period of seven days. You start off on the first day taking 0.5 mg of Suboxone and thats it. Plus you take your regular opiates but no more than .5 Suboxone. Second day you do the same thing 0.5. Im not gonna give them any more advice on that I dont remember the exact details but read that article gives you sound scientific information. Ive noticed that a lot of these addiction doctors arent much better than the old OxyContin pill mills in the sense that they dont really care to help you out they care that youre gonna be coming back what often than a pain patient would be. They get you hooked on the axis you lose half your shit when it spirals out of control to heroin and fentanyl and then they really are back in for even more billable hours when you need to take Suboxone or methadone. Its a total scam but there are some good doctors out there. Im lucky I have one right now. I dont have to do drug tests and I do it all virtually the guy gives me a prescription for a month of them at a time I dont even have to do a witness dose anymore. Its great. It makes me wanna not abuse. I only had one little slip which is pretty miraculous. Good luck op feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

Im not gonna pretend to know the specifics, its in Dr. Sarnos books. That approach didnt work for me and I was referred to a pain therapist. This was before my surgeries, when I was still undiagnosed. She didnt tell me my pain wasnt real but gave me techniques through controlling my anxiety when the pain got intense and meditative type techniques that would help me control my pain levels. It allowed me to greatly decrease my medications and I think that decrease in meds allowed me to feel the pain in a way that actually got me diagnosed after years of being told I was med seeking.

Idk seems weird to me but thats fine I would rather not have a huge tolerance to it and be high all the time. So should I just stay completely clean even if Im sick as fuck and go with the plan even though its slow. Kinda a stupid question ig cause if I didnt stop using while on methadone then when I get to 50mg and try to stop using the fetty My body will be used to both so I guess you gotta just tough it out and let yourself get adjusted?

I always ran out of my script with a week before I could get it filled but never got WD.  Then a year ago I learned the dark net. And started getting oxy 80s mundipharma.  Always sealed blisters in a box. (Always bought bulk) 50 at a time. Started with only doing a quarter pill (20mg) every few days, then every other , then every night. All the while my tolerance getting bigger. Last 5 months I've been at 90-110mg every single night.

Decided to taper with what I had left (60 or so 80s) after reading up on WD and tapering and comfort meds on here. With help from bropiates I came up with a plan and scored comfort meds.

My twin 4 year old boys get home from school around then too so that adds to it. I'd probably feel a little better if I could just lay down but who has time to that every day from noon till 4. That 4pm dose is such relief. I could probably take it a little earlier but I try to muscle through to get till at least 9pm. Last few nights I've been adding 300mg of gaba too.

402,"I just went through this with my GF. I suggest you taper off to a lower dosage before going CT. I went off at about 9mg five times a day, orally. She got down to 6mg twice a day and had 1 full day of WD. It was hard and took about a week just to feel somewhat normal. Insomnia and skin feeling like it was on fire were the hardest parts for me. Multi-vitamin, magnesium 250mg a day (including whats in your multi), C 1000mg, D3. Hot hot EPSOM salt baths prior to bed. Valium will help with anxiety. I was very concerned about Kratom as well and only used 2-4g of red variant at night to help me sleep. During the day I would just deal with the WD symptoms. My anecdotal experience with Kratom is that it pauses WD. So the less you take, the quicker you can restart WD. For instance, when I took 4g at night, I wouldn't start feeling major WD until 6pm the next night. If I took 2g I would start feeling WD almost immediately after waking up. About a week in after taking Kratom at night I decided to take a hot bath followed by 10mg of valium which knocked me out. After that point, I never took kratom again.

411,"Well now remember there's plenty of functional addicts who basically run on the same motto of ""I never take too much"" so don't think that alone means you haven't got an addiction. Though people who are overly semantic about it could make the argument of dependence vs addiction but with opiates, in my experience, they go hand in hand. It's the physical dependence symptoms that bring on the addictive behaviours usually. I wouldn't be so hung up on the ""am I an addict"" question or look at it as some extremely negative thing. It is what it is. What you don't want to do is delude yourself into believing your not an addict when you are as you'll never get better with that mindset. As they probably teach in AA, the first step towards recovery is admitting you have a problem. I've never done a program but that rule is absolutely true in my experience. Alternatively if you don't like thinking of yourself as an addict, due to taboo and stigma then at a minimum acknowledge your physically dependent on your medicine if that becomes the case. Accepting this stuff for what it is, is the biggest step you need to take when trying to stop, as you probably know from AA.  If I were you I'd just accept I'm taking an addictive medicine in a way that will lead to physical dependence and deal with it when you have to or want to. Just don't delude yourself into thinking that because of the circumstances you won't become dependent or possibly addicted, it just comes with taking the medication sadly.  You just need to be aware of the risks your taking.  On the same token, with your illness, it's totally understandable that you'd need something like that to take the edge off and they're also presumably reducing pain from Leukaemia, I don't mean to come off as judgemental. If you weren't sick I'd tell you to stop but given you have an Illbess where opiates are a totally valid treatment, I'm not going to say stop, I just recommend caution.

If you can have a drink poured in front of you or a line of dope set in front of you and not do it, you're not an addict. If your willpower can keep you clean, you don't have the disease. Now, does spirituality fix that? I don't claim to know. I think there's a lot going on that helps people who work the steps.

You end up having to take fist-fulls of kratom pills just to get rid of sickness and function. I dont remember the last time I used clean oxy, but I would imagine going from pressed M30s to oxy is less of a drop off then pressed M30s to kratom. If I were in your situation, I would take the clean oxys orally to keep you alright, but you have to been honest with yourself and be very frugal with taking them. Then when you start feeling the sweatiness/beginning WD symptoms, snort a quarter or less of the dirty ones just to keep those terrible feelings at bay.

The idea of it is that the medication leaves your body so slowly over time that withdrawal is minimal. If you just want to be done with medication completely you could always try Vitamin C mega dosing. This is a great article explaining how it works.

448,"I did it millions of times. 5-9 day sub taper to go from shooting 1-2g heroin per day to zero opiates. It works great. Especially the first times you do it. And given that you are on pretty low doses, you have a good chance of going through it quite comfortably. What I dont understand, are you trying to get clean before your vacation, or are you using sub to get through your vacation? If I were you, I would go on sub about 2 weeks before your vaccay so youll have a few zero-days under your belt before you leave. By the time you leave home you should be physically ok and the fact that you are away from home will make it much easier to get it out of your head. About the doseI dont know how strong your h is and if theres fent in it, but if its actually heroin and about as weak as the stuff we have here in GERMANY, 2mg a day could be enough. You may need more on the first two days, but after that, you need quite a low dose to stay out of withdrawal.  So, if maintenance is your plan, take 2mg a day. You may need a second dose on days one and two. But after that, 2mg is fine. Splitting it up into two doses works even better.  If you wanna get clean, heres how I do it. Please note that Im usually comming from higher dosages, 1-2g IV real heroin a day:  I wait 16 hours. No fent, no need to wait longer. I take 2 x 4mg on day one. 4mg on day 2&3. 2mg on days 4&5. 1mg for days 6&7. Day 8 I take nothing. On day 9 I may take 1mg one more time if I feel rough. After that, expect occasional stomach issues and generally feeling a bit rough for a few days, but very manageable. And being away from home will make it much easier, because its out of your head.  Of course, thats only my personal experience, but I got clean like that dozens of times, definitely before every family vacation and it works.

After hearing the details of my psychotic break and the drug use that surrounded it, my new psychiatrist asked if I wanted to see how low I could go, to which I enthusiastically obliged. Im down to 30mg from 80mg over the past 5 months with 0 symptoms so far, and its just really hard to believe that Ive been on this stuff at that dose for what is practically my entire adult life. Im really starting to feel emotions and remember things that before just seemed to be like fog to me.

Im seriously intimidated yet excited to be stepping into a role like this. Would not be able to do this job sober. I start on 5/2 and Im just praying to God all goes well.  Almost 5 months completely sober. I was abusing pseudoephedrine for a little while last year. Its a far cry from heroin but it was seriously destroying my body and mind. My wife finding out was a blessing in disguise. I shared briefly about a month ago that we were having some troubles but I feel as though our relationship got stronger over the past month. I make more of an effort to spend time with her, with the med change my sex drive actually exists so were more active in that realm than we ever have been in the nearly 5 years weve known each other, and caring for the puppies has definitely brought us closer.  Im not sure what else to say other than I miss you guys. This sub was a huge cornerstone of my mental health for just about all of 2014-2017. Wouldnt have gotten off dope if it wasnt for it.

Get into a MAT program and use subs for a month/years depending how long u used and if you feel like you are okay and not in risk of relapse you should taper off to a very low dose every other day and stop. You do not need to take Suboxone for the rest of ur life but it is an option for some..if the subs dont work for you then maybe try methadone but IMO thats a last resort because its more long term. Also a good chance you should see a addiction counselor or therapist if you cant stop on ur own there is probably deeper reason.

Whereas normally  12 hours after my last dose I'll start feeling the sickness heavy, and 24 hours after my last dose I'll be in full blown dopesickness. But this one and only time, the first 2 days I was totally fine, barely felt the WD, chilled and watched TV.  But then it hit midnight on the end of the 2nd day and man the WD hit me HARD, that night was agony my skin was burning, major chills, all the rest. I made it until the morning of day 4 and snapped and relapsed. But yeah ever since then, I've never had it where the first 2 days were fine. Next WD it went back to being 12 hours is where the sickness starts and 24 hours full on dopesick.   And I was getting legit pharma stuff.

But if you are in Europe you don't have to worry about fent being in them. Mine were the Sandoz 80's / 40's I imagine you probably have similar or the mundipharma ones. I hope you get lucky  but for me each consecutive detox is worse if I went back on 320mg a day (I was doing 480mg so similar to yours)  for 2 weeks,  I'd have full blown dopesickness  just like kicking a year of daily use.

Go for a walk, workout, read, meditate, cook a good meal, anything healthy that you can do consistently. It's also good to have a plan for when carvings come up.

(assuming its a healthy activity) You need to drop this whole pity party feeling sorry for yourself attitude and start making a real effort to change your life. It sounds like you have an underlying depression issue, you should talk to a counselor about that and the possibility of psych meds. If you take a hot shot, you will throw away everything you worked so hard to accomplish in the past 2 years, and you won't be able to go back and fix it, because you will be DEAD!

Dirty D I hope your plane ride went alright- ive been flying since I was 6months old (95% of my family lives overseas) but I still get scared shitless every time im in a plane taking off or landing, so I totally get being freaked tf out by it.   Anyways. Im still in bed rn, cuz these last few weeks been hectic and I deserve a goddamn lie in. I'm taking R out for dinner for his bday today, but before that I gotta go get some groceries. Sounds like a chill day, but lately I've been so stressed and slightly overwhelmed by just getting stuff done- it's all gotten done, but it's been exhausting- that I feel like today is just yet another day I have to be like perfect and on point and can't relax. Idk why, and I'm trying my best to find a good mental balance of keeping up the momentum of pushing myself to get things done even when I feel like I physically and mentally can't vs making sure my brain is still in a decent place, but it's hard.   My apocalypse anxiety still isn't really alleviated by any means, although ofc it's better than it was on Sunday where I pretty much had a minor panic attack. I talked to my dad for like an hour- I'm really grateful that after a shitty relationship with my parents for almost my whole life, now I can talk to both of them about almost anything (something my childhood self could've never in a billion years imagined) and they'll be, for the most part, supportive and chill. Talking to him helped cuz his mind is very similar to mine and despite also having anxiety he's an intelligent and rational person, but he said something about me seeming kinda lonely when I was visiting them that stuck out to me.   Basically he said that he sensed that I was somewhat lonely, and one of the only things other than a good friend group and supportive work environment that can alleviate these kinds of worries about the future is a good life partner with whom you feel comfortable about facing potential dangers ahead together. Never thought I'd see the day where my father was telling me to get a man lmao.   And I mean sure, he has a point, but I think instead of loneliness what he sensed from me was more of the fact that for the first time in my life I'm really comfortable with and at times happy about spending time alone. My father has always known me as an extremely social person, who sought mental refuge in the distraction of other people. That's definitely not who I am anymore. Don't get me wrong, I still am extroverted at the end of the day, and I do still enjoy and value the company of others, but being alone (not like single even [but that too lol], just literally alone for even just a day) used to be my worst fear and now it's something that I actually cherish greatly.   Like I think a huge part of why I did drugs- not just dope, but booze too and weed back when weed was a problem for me- is because I was so shit scared of just sitting alone with my sober mind. I had no control over the void and felt as if if I were to spend even a few minutes just silently contemplating my own mind, I would fall backwards into a place I could never come out of. So a big part of recovery for me has been learning how to not just be okay with sitting alone and sober, but how to actively enjoy doing so.   And i think that so far, so good. It sounds cheesy af but i love hanging out with myself and having conversations and debates and making stupid jokes with myself. The only person you can ever fully guarantee will always be with you is YOU,  so you'll never have an enjoyable life if you can't, when you need to, be your own best friend and enjoy your own company. If it gets misconstrued as loneliness, so what. I'm happy, and that is what counts.   Anyways. I gotta get going, my dumb lil dog is whining to be walked and idw make her wait.

533,"There are two ways to start. The traditional method is to wait until you are pretty seriously into withdrawal (minimum of 12 hours since last dose of opioids but more is better), then begin by taking 2mg at a time up to 8mg in day 1, 16 in day 2-3, and ideally 8mg or less from that point on (most people are fine with 4mg/day after day 4 or 5). The problem here is A) suffering with WDs until you are ready to begin and B) the risk of precipitated WDs if you start the Suboxone too early, which can be really hard to calculate these days now that Fent is in everything and it stays in your system longer. You DO NOT WANT to experience PWDs so be very very careful here. The second option is called the Bernese ""Micro-Induction"" Method and it is the much better way to go IMO. Here you start by taking very low-dose amounts of Suboxone while you are still using the opioids you are planning to quit (Oxy, Fent, H, etc.). You keep using as normal but on Day 1 you take two .5 Mg doses of Suboxone. Day 2 you take two 1 Mg doses. Day 3 you take two 2 Mg doses. On Day 4 you take two 4 Mg doses and you cut the opioids in half. On Day 5 you can take up to 16 Mg Suboxone and at that point you really won't feel the opioid effects even if you try to do some. You will experience some level of discomfort at that point but not much and it will only last a day or two tops. From that point on you just go with a maintenance level dose of 4-8 Mg per day same as above. Either way, kicking Suboxone after prolonged usage is just as hard as kicking anything else so only use it as long as necessary to get past the danger zone for relapse. 1-3 months is fine. 1-3 years is a bad idea. Good luck! Please note: I am not a doctor. Please speak with your physician or seek other forms of medical advice before you make a decision on which way to go with all of this.

539,"For me it's the blocking effect it has on other opioids, and the ceiling effect. If I take oxycodone, Vicodin or most other opioids they would do nothing for me. The ceiling effect means that even if you get high from them (and most people don't), it's very limited, a little energy boost, and it's never more than that; doubling up won't do any good. So I'm stable on it and it keeps me from doing other opiates/opioids. By contrast as soon as I do hydro or oxy I'm fiending for more. With luck I hope to get on the Sublocade shot which creates a very slow taper, to the point where some people get 2-3 shots and just move on, feeling no withdrawal. But all during that time, oxys etc. would do nothing for me. Fentanyl might break through, but luckily I have never wanted to do fentanyl or street drugs in general. I always wanted to just do 10 mg oxycodone at night. But then that felt so good I wanted some for morning. And then a midday boost, you know? And then a couple after work.
